This is effectively up to 10 points of extra credit, but I don't like thinking about these skills or these kinds of experiences as "extra."
I believe this category is as valuable as the core skills, but necessarily fuzzier and more open-ended.
These 10 optional points are a way for you to customize your curriculum in this class to your own interests and goals.
