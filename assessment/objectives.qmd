## Tiered Scoring

Each objective is scored on a 4 / 5 / 6 point scale based on the quality and independence of your demonstration of the skill. 

| Points | Label | Description |
| --- | ------ | -------- |
| *No grade* | *No demonstration* | *You have not yet demonstrated this skill.* |
| **4** | **Meets Expectations** | You demonstrate the skill correctly in structured or familiar contexts (for example, following a guided assignment or closely modeled example). |
| **5** | **Exceeds Expectations** | You apply the skill correctly and independently in a novel context, with clear, well-chosen code that would generalize to new datasets or problems. |
| **6** | **Outstanding** | You use the skill in an especially expansive way: combining it with other skills, applying it to a complex or less-structured task, or going beyond the scope of in-class examples. |

All three levels (4, 5, 6) are successful demonstrations. If you do not demonstrate a skill at least at the 4-point level, you will not earn credit for that standard.

Earning an average of 5 points per standard will earn you all 60 points. An average lower than 5 points can still result in an 'A' grade for the class if you complete [enrichment activities](enrichment.qmd).

Each assignment will receive a score for each standard it addresses based on this rubric.
Individual assignments may not be resubmitted for a higher score, but you may improve your score for a standard by submitting new assignments that demonstrate that standard at a higher level.

*Higher scores always replace lower scores for core standards*, so after earning a high score with an impressive assignment, subsequent assignments that use the skill at a more basic level won't lower your score.

## General Grading Guidelines


- **It is possible to earn a score without checking off each specific requirement if the overall work clearly demonstrates foundational (4), strong (5), or outstanding (6) skills.** These guidelines are intended to give you confidence in your work before submission. They should not be interpreted as perfectly rigid requirements to work against you. If you have met all the expectations listed for a score, you will not earn lower than that score.
- Code failing to execute correctly does not necessarily preclude earning points for an objective. R scripts, code chunks, and knitted documents that do not execute or render as intended may still receive credit if the problems are minor and there is evidence of the objective in other parts of the submission.
- All three levels represent successful demonstrations. No credit is given if the skill is not demonstrated at minimum 4-point level.
- Higher scores always replace lower scores, so students can improve by submitting new work.
- Individual assignments cannot be resubmitted for regrading, but students may submit new assignments demonstrating the same standard at a higher level. In rare cases, students may be invited to correct trivial errors or reattempt assignments following significant misunderstanding.
- The less structured the project, the higher the potential score. Structured projects with extensive scaffolding typically cap at 4-5 points, while unstructured projects can more easily reach 6.


## Quarter 1 Core Learning Objectives {#sec-core-standards}

The 12 Quarter‑1 core learning objectives are all **technical and observable**. For each one ask: *Is there clear, identifiable code or output that shows this skill?*

The objectives are listed (more or less) in the order they are covered in class, but you can demonstrate them in any order.

### Grading Criteria:

**4 Points:**

- [ ]  **IMPORTANT: To receive 4 points for this standard, read-in functions must run without error for the grader after cloning your assignment repository to a local machine.** Ensure that:
