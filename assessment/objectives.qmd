## Quarter 1 Core Standards {#sec-core-standards}

The 12 Quarter‑1 core learning objectives are all **technical and observable**. For each one ask: *Is there clear, identifyable code or output that shows this skill?*

The objectives are listed (more or less) in the order they are covered in class, but you can demonstrate them in any order.

1. **RStudio + Quarto workflow**
    - Create an RStudio project for course work, use relative paths, and knit simple Quarto documents that combine code and narrative.
2. **GitHub repositories and version control**
    - Create and maintain a GitHub repo with README, .gitignore, and a commit history that reflects real work over time.
3. **Base R syntax and data structures**
    - Use vectors, lists, and data frames correctly in scripts, including creation, indexing, and simple manipulation.
4. **Control flow (if/else, loops)**
    - Use if/else and loops to branch logic and automate repetitive tasks in multiple contexts.
5. **Missing data and subsetting/filtering**
    - Detect, remove, or handle missing values and subset data with logical conditions in multiple contexts.
6. **Importing data with tidyverse tools**
    - Import datasets (e.g., CSV/TSV) with readr or similar, handling paths and basic options.
7. **Data manipulation with dplyr and pipelines**
    - Use multiple dplyr verbs (filter, select, mutate, summarize, arrange, group_by) in chained pipelines.
8. **Tidy data structure (identify and apply)**
    - Diagnose untidy data and reshape to a tidy format, with explanation.
9. **Reshaping data with tidyr**
    - Use multiple tidyr functions (pivot_longer/pivot_wider/separate/unite) to reshape data.
10. **Character strings with stringr**
    - Use stringr functions (e.g., str_detect, str_replace, str_extract) to solve text cleaning or extraction tasks.
11. **Factors with forcats**
    - Recode, reorder, and/or lump factor levels to prepare categorical variables for analysis or plotting.
12. **Basic reporting: plots and descriptives in Quarto**
    - Create simple ggplot2 plots and compute/report basic descriptive statistics (means, medians, counts, proportions) in a Quarto document with clear captions and narrative.

## Tiered Scoring

Each standard is scored on a 4 / 5 / 6 point scale based on the quality and independence of your demonstration of the skill. 

| Points | Label | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *No grade* | *No demonstration* | *You have not yet demonstrated this skill.* |
| **4** | **Meets Expectations** | You demonstrate the skill accurately in structured or familiar contexts (for example, following a guided assignment or closely modeled example). |
| **5** | **Exceeds Expectations** | You apply the skill correctly and independently in a novel context, with clear, well-chosen code that would generalize to new datasets or problems. |
| **6** | **Outstanding** | You use the skill in an especially expansive way: combining it with other skills, applying it to a complex or less-structured task, or going beyond the scope of in-class examples. |

All three levels (4, 5, 6) are successful demonstrations. If you do not demonstrate a skill at least at the 4-point level, you will not earn credit for that standard.

Each assignment will receive a score for each standard it addresses based on this rubric.
Individual assignments may not be resubmitted for a higher score.

You may improve your score for a standard by submitting new assignments that demonstrate that standard at a higher level.
*Higher scores always replace lower scores for core standards*, so after earning a high score with an impressive assignment, subsequent assignments that use the skill at a more basic level won't lower your score.

<!-- ### Example -->

<!-- You submit a "skeleton repo" assignment, showing that you have successfully created a GitHub repository with a README and .gitignore file. This assignment earns you a 4 for Standard 2 (GitHub repositories and version control). Later, you work with a partner on a "make-a-mess" assignment and opt to create a dedicated repo for your work. Both you and your partner contribute commits and branches and effectively use GitHub issues to track your progress, earning you a 5 for Standard 2 that replaces your 4. In future assignments, you can use GitHub minimally and still keep your 5, or you can choose to continue to showing more sophisticated use of GitHub to replace your 5 with a 6. -->
