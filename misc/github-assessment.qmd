title: "Using GitHub Repos & GitHub Classrooms"
---

This course uses a mix of regular old GitHub Repositories and GitHub Classrooms assignment repos for assignment completion.

## GitHub Repositories

A GitHub Repository (repo) is a storage space where your project files live. 
You can create a repo for any project you want to work on, and it allows you to track changes, collaborate with others, and manage your code effectively.

Creating and maintaining GitHub repos connected to RStudio projects is a core learning objective for the course.
There are plenty of course resources ([lecture slides](), [book chapter](), [walkthrough]()) to guide you through the process of creating and using GitHub repos.

## GitHub Classrooms

GitHub Classrooms is a tool that allows instructors to create and manage assignments using GitHub repositories. 
When you are assigned work through GitHub Classrooms, you will use a link to accept the assignment, which will create a new repository for you to work in.

The workflow for using GitHub Classrooms is as follows:

1. Accept the assignment using the provided link, which creates a new GitHub repository for you.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine as an RStudio project.
3. Complete the assignment work in RStudio, committing changes as you work.
4. Make a final commit and push your changes back to the GitHub repository for submission.

After submitting, GH will automatically create a `feedback` branch and create a pull request (PR) flagging your work as ready to grade. 
If you are not automatically subscribed to the PR (you should get an email notifying you of it), you should navigate to the "Pull Requests" tab in your assignment repo on GitHub and manually subscribe to it.

You must *also* complete the [Project Submission Form](d2m-r.github.io/submit.html) to submit your work to the grading queue.

Your grader will review your work directly in the GitHub repository and provide feedback through comments on your code and/or the pull request.
If you are subscribed to the PR, you will receive notice when feedback is provided.

You can check the status of your submission and view feedback by navigating to the "Pull Requests" tab in your assignment repo on GitHub.
Your grader will leave a comment on the PR with a summary of points earned for the assignment. 
Additional comments may be left on specific lines of code or files within the repo.


## Demonstrating Core Standard 2: Using GitHub Repos & GitHub Classrooms

Using GitHub Classrooms will familiarize you with version control basics, but on its own is not sufficient to demonstrate Core Standard 2.
The following guidelines explain what is required to demonstrate Core Standard 2 at each level.
This standard is less straightforward that most others, so you can use these guidelines as a checklist to ensure you are meeting the expectations for your desired point level.

These guidelines apply to all assignments unless specified elsewhere.

### Basic Class Expectation, No Points

To fully participate in the class, you need to have simple proficiency with GitHub Classrooms.
You are expected to be able to execute the following Classrooms workflow, separately from the core standard:

- [ ] Clone the GitHub Classroom assignment repo to your local machine as an RStudio project
- [ ] Complete work in RStudio
- [ ] Commit and push changes to the GitHub Classroom assignment repo for submission
- [ ] Subscribe to the auto-generated pull request to review grades and communicate with your grader

### 4 Points

The minimum requirements to demonstrate Core Standard 2 at the 4-point level for an assignment are:

- [ ] Follow the GitHub Classrooms workflow as described above
- [ ] Add or edit a README.md file describing the assignment, the work you have done, and the structure of the repo
- [ ] Add or edit a .gitignore file that excludes at least one element in your project/repo
    - You can opt to use a standard R .gitignore template, but you must add at least one additional custom rule with commented description *that actually ignores something.*
    - The easiest way to do this is just to add something you don't strictly need (like a localonly folder or `ignore-me.R`) then ignore that file/folder explicitly.
    - Be sure your added ignore line does not ignore any files necessary for assignment submission (e.g., Quarto notebooks, data files, the README.md, the .gitignore itself, your .html or .pdf knitted output, etc.)
- [ ] Make at least 3 meaningful commits with descriptive messages that reflect your work over time.
    - This does not include any commits that are made for you automatically, like when the repo is initialized.

### 5 Points

To demonstrate Core Standard 2 at the 5-point level for an assignment, you must go beyond the GitHub Classrooms workflow and create your own dedicated GitHub repository for the assignment.

- [ ] Create a *dedicated, private* GitHub repository for the assignment, connected to an RStudio project.
    - This repo should *only* contain files for this assignment (no extra files from other work) and should be created from scratch (not cloned, not a subfolder of a larger repo).
    - If you will need to use files from a Classrooms assignment repo, you should download them and add them manually to your dedicated repo. Do not clone the Classrooms repo directly. The goal is to show the whole process of creating and managing your own repo start to finish.
- [ ] Complete all requirements above about README.md, .gitignore, and commits.
- [ ] Create a resonable structure for your repo, with at least 2 subdirectories (e.g., `data/`, `scripts/`, `output/`, etc.) to organize your files.
    - The directories should be meaningfully named to reflect their contents.
    - Each directory should have at least 1 file in it (GitHub does not track empty directories!). These can be "dummy" files if necessary, but they should be appropriate for the directory's purpose (e.g., an .R script in the `scripts/` folder, a .csv file in the `data/` folder, an .html or .pdf file in the `output/` folder, etc.)
- [ ] Invite the instructor and/or TA as collaborators on your private repo so they can view and grade your work.
    - Be sure you set the repo to private so that only you and the instructor/TA can see it! You will receive feedback and grades in the repo itself, and **if you don't make it private others will be able to see those grades!!**
- [ ] Create at least 1 issue in your repo
    - *Required:* A notice that you have completed the assignment and are ready for grading, tagging both Dr. Dowling and your TA. The issue should specify which standards you believe you have met in the assignment and at what level.
    - *Optional:* Additional questions, comments, or notes you have about the assignment or your work on it (please do not tag the instructor/TA in issues other than the submission notice).
    
    
### 6 Points

To demonstrate Core Standard 2 at the 6-point level for an assignment, you must meet all requirements for the 5-point level and go beyond them in meaningful ways.
There is no fixed list of additional requirements for the 6-point level; rather, you should aim to exceed expectations in multiple areas of your GitHub repo management.
Some ways you might do this include:

- Making more than the minimum required number of meaningful commits (e.g., 5 or more), with clear and descriptive messages.
- Implementing a more complex or thoughtful directory structure that reflects the needs of your project.
- Adding additional documentation to your README.md file, such as usage instructions, dependencies, or examples of output.
- Using advanced Git/GitHub features (e.g., branching, merging, forking, pull requests), to manage different versions or features of your work.
- Creating additional issues to track bugs, enhancements, or tasks related to your assignment.
- Collaborating with assignments on a shared repo, with all collaborators making meaningful contributions independently.
