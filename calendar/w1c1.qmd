The problem is that if they are includes with multiple on the index page, the variables would need to process before being included.

**Tasks:**

-   Create a GitHub education account
-   Complete the [pre-quarter survey](https://forms.gle/bZR1ntWPs4JA1mS56)
-   Join the Slack workspace (invites sent to your \uchicago.edu address)

Don't procrastinate on selecting your dataset! Ideally you will have entered the class with a dataset ready to go. If you didn't, that needs to be your top priority. The whole course is centered around progressing on your final research project, and you can't do anything without a dataset.

When you have a dataset in mind, review the [dataset selection guidelines](assessment/final-project.html) to be sure it meets the requirements. If you have questions, send an email to Dr. Dowling and cc your section TA.

There's a lot of setup tasks you need to complete before our second class meeting. We started in class, but you'll need to finish on your own.

What exactly do you need to do? Look ahead to the **"Before class"** tab for next class. This is what you should *always* do to see what you're responsible for doing *before that class meeting*.
