TODO: see if there's a way to make these variables
The problem is that if they are includes with multiple on the index page, the variables would need to process before being included.

**Class plans:**

-   Tuesday: Introduction to the course, syllabus review
-   Thursday: Debugging & problem-solving strategies
-   Example Assignment - Tentatively, the plan here is:
    -   Tuesday end of class: connect RStudio and GitHub, accept the assignment, and clone the repo
    -   Before Thursday: figure out anything you didn't get working on Tuesday, up to having the repo locally
    -   Thursday end of class: complete the assignment, fill out the submission doc, push to GH, and create a pull request
    -   Realistically, we may have little time to work on this in class. There are *detailed* instructions to get you through each step of this assignment on this site, other R learning sites, and in the files of the assignment itself. Whether or not we work on it in class, you should complete it before Tuesday Week 2.
    -   *See "Assignments & To-Do" below for details about the assignment itself.*
    

**Primary learning objectives:**

-   (1) RStudio + Quarto workflow
-   (2) GitHub repositories and version control

**Graded Submissions:**

-   Accountability Plan - Initial Submission
    -   Due: Monday, January 12th, 2026
    -   Submit to Canvas.
    -   Create an individual accountability plan to follow throughout the quarter.
    -   See the [accountability page](../assessment/accountability.html) for details about this assignment.
    -   *We'll talk about this on Thursday.*

**Recommended Exercises:**

-   Example Assignment:
    -   This is a crash course in using RStudio with GitHub, working in Quarto documents with markdown, and running simple R code within a Quarto document.
    -   Use this [GH classroom invite](https://classroom.github.com/a/oiL9tsfr) to access the assignment so you can figure out the process of cloning, editing, committing, pushing, and submitting assignments through GitHub and GH Classroom.
    -   Between Tuesday and Thursday, you should get everything set up at least through have the repo cloned on your computer and accessible with an RStudio project.
    -   Before Week 2 you should complete the rest of the assignment, using the problem-solving slides to help if you get stuck.
-   [Guided Exercise: Create and Sync a GitHub Repo with RStudio](../materials/guides/walkthrough-github-rstudio.html)
    -   This exercise walks you through creating a GitHub repository and connecting it to an RStudio project.
    -   This is similar to what you'll do for the example assignment, but with more detailed instructions and without the logistical complications of GH Classroom.

**Other To-do:**

-   [ ] Join the [course Slack workspace](http://d2m-r.slack.com) and introduce yourself in the `#introductions` channel
    -   Minimally, send a message including your name and github username, but we'd also love to know a little bit about you and/or why you're taking the class!
-   [ ] Review the syllabus policies and assessment structure on this site
-   [ ] Get your GitHub education account set up and join the d2m-r organization
-   [ ] Familiarize yourself with the course GitHub organization and student hub repos
