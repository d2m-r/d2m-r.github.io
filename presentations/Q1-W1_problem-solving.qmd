# Solving Your Own Problems

## A Preface

-   Debugging is programming.
    -   It's not extra; it's essential.
-   Programming depends on collaboration.
    -   Asking for help is not cheating!
-   Questions \> Answers
    -   Get the basics down, then get everything else you need when you need it.
-   Troubleshooting includes debugging, *among other things*.
    -   These skills translate beyond fixing code.
    -   Please stop telling me that "in programming it's called debugging."

## The Myth of the "Programmer"

:::: columns

::: {.column width="60%"}

-   Programmers are geniuses who have a sacred knowledge.
-   The debugging coders do is a highly specialized skill.
-   If you're debugging, you did something wrong.
-   Programming requires mastery of a programming language.
-   You can recognize an expert programmer by their abundant knowledge of the language.
    - or their wardrobe of unwashed hoodies meticulously curated to signal how much they don't care about anything but code

## The Reality of Getting Shit Done

:::: columns

::: {.column width="60%"}

-   Debugging is not extra – it's the majority of the process.
-   Debugging is one application of more generalizable problem-solving skills.
-   Programming depends on collaboration.
-   Once you "master" the foundations, you learn the rest by just going for it.
-   You can recognize an expert programmer by their ability to find solutions.
    -   They might also wear gross hoodies, but don't we all from time to time?

## Questions \> Answers
Knowing how to ask the right questions to solve problems and learn independently is legitimately, indisputably more valuable than the party trick of recalling lots of functions and language-specific processes.
:::

::: notes

-   **Debugging is not extra – it's essential**
    -   80% of programming time is spent debugging <!-- there's got to be a cartoon for this -->
-   **Troubleshooting includes debugging, *among other things*.**
    -   These skills translate beyond fixing code.
    -   Please stop telling me that "in programming it's called debugging."
-   **Programming depends on collaboration**
    -   Asking for help is not cheating!
    -   Programming knowledge is freely **distributed and shared**
-   **Questions \> Answers**
    -   Get the basics down, then get everything else you need when you need it.
-   **Master the foundations and then just go for it**

# Best Practices

> The best way to troubleshoot is to avoid it. 

## Keep Your Code:

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   **Standardized**
    -   style guides, internal consistency
-   **Intelligible** - clear comments and naming
    -   informative comments, meaningful naming, documentation

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   **Maintainable**
    -   sustainable over time and transportable
-   **Contextualized**
    -   appropriate for your community and your project
:::
:::::

## Standardized Code

-   **Standardized** code is easier to read, understand, and maintain.
-   Use a style guide
-   Maintain internal consistency

## R Standard Formatting

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
### R is pretty forgiving

-   Whitespace insensitive
-   Few "forbidden" characters

### So choose where to be cautious

-   Avoid special characters (even if they are technically allowed)
-   Prioritize readability over conciseness
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Style Guides

-   **The right style is the one you can stick to**
    -   [Google's R Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.html)
    -   [Tidyverse Style Guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/)
    -   [Individualized Style Guide]()
        -   my own guide, a tweaked version of the tidyverse guide

# Intelligible Code

## Commenting Best Practices

:::::::: columns
:::: {.column width="60%"}
::: incremental
1.  Comments should not duplicate code
2.  Good comments do not excuse unclear code
3.  If you can't write a clear comment, there may be a problem with the code
4.  Comments should dispel confusion, not cause it
5.  Explain unidiomatic code in comments
6.  Provide links to the original source of copied code
7.  Include links to external references where helpful
8.  Add comments when fixing bugs
9.  Use comments to mark incomplete implementations

## Keep Collaboration in Mind

Be kind not just to others who may work with you, but also to future-you.
:::

::: callout-important
## Natural languages \> programming languages

The language you speak is infinitely more intuitive, nuanced, specific, and adaptable. Take advantage of it.

## Meaningful Naming

> “There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.”
> — Phil Karlton

::::::: columns

::::: {.column width="40%"}

::: callout-warning
## Names should describe the named thing!

Not as easy as it sounds.
:::

- Avoid disinformation
- Use pronounceable names
- Use searchable names
- Pick one word/format per concept
- Avoid encodings
