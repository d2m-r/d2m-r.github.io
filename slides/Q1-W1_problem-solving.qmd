## A Preface

-   Debugging is programming.
    -   It's not extra; it's essential.
-   Programming depends on collaboration.
    -   Asking for help is not cheating!
-   Questions \> Answers
    -   Get the basics down, then get everything else you need when you need it.
-   Troubleshooting includes debugging, *among other things*.
    -   These skills translate beyond fixing code.
    -   Please stop telling me that "in programming it's called debugging."

## The Myth of the "Programmer"

::::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
-   Programmers are geniuses who have a sacred knowledge. `r 2+2`
-   The debugging coders do is a highly specialized skill.
-   If you're debugging, you did something wrong.
-   Programming requires mastery of a programming language.
-   You can recognize an expert programmer by their abundant knowledge of the language.
    -   or their wardrobe of unwashed hoodies meticulously curated to signal how much they don't care about anything but code

-   Debugging is not extra – it's the majority of the process.
-   Debugging is one application of more generalizable problem-solving skills.
-   Programming depends on collaboration.
-   Once you "master" the foundations, you learn the rest by just going for it.
-   You can recognize an expert programmer by their ability to find solutions.
    -   They might also wear gross hoodies, but don't we all from time to time?

## Questions \> Answers

Knowing how to ask the right questions to solve problems and learn independently is legitimately, indisputably more valuable than the party trick of recalling lots of functions and language-specific processes.

::: notes
-   **Debugging is not extra – it's essential**
    -   80% of programming time is spent debugging <!-- there's got to be a cartoon for this -->
-   **Troubleshooting includes debugging, *among other things*.**
    -   These skills translate beyond fixing code.
    -   Please stop telling me that "in programming it's called debugging."
-   **Programming depends on collaboration**
    -   Asking for help is not cheating!
    -   Programming knowledge is freely **distributed and shared**
-   **Questions \> Answers**
    -   Get the basics down, then get everything else you need when you need it.
-   **Master the foundations and then just go for it**

# Best Practices

> The best way to troubleshoot is to avoid it.

## Keep Your Code:

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   **Standardized**
    -   style guides, internal consistency
-   **Intelligible** - clear comments and naming
    -   informative comments, meaningful naming, documentation
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   **Maintainable**
    -   sustainable over time and transportable
-   **Contextualized**
    -   appropriate for your community and your project
:::
:::::

## Standardized Code

-   **Standardized** code is easier to read, understand, and maintain.
-   Use a style guide
-   Maintain internal consistency

## R Standard Formatting

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
### R is pretty forgiving

-   Whitespace insensitive
-   Few "forbidden" characters

### So choose where to be cautious

-   Avoid special characters (even if they are technically allowed)
-   Prioritize readability over conciseness
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Style Guides

-   **The right style is the one you can stick to**
    -   [Google's R Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.html)
    -   [Tidyverse Style Guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/)
    -   [Individualized Style Guide]()
        -   my own guide, a tweaked version of the tidyverse guide

# Intelligible Code

## Commenting Best Practices

::::::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
1.  Comments should not duplicate code
2.  Good comments do not excuse unclear code
3.  If you can't write a clear comment, there may be a problem with the code
4.  Comments should dispel confusion, not cause it
5.  Explain unidiomatic code in comments
6.  Provide links to the original source of copied code
7.  Include links to external references where helpful
8.  Add comments when fixing bugs
9.  Use comments to mark incomplete implementations
:::

::::: {.column width="40%" style="font-size: 1.3em"}
::: {.callout-tip style="margin-bottom: 2em"}
## Keep Collaboration in Mind

Be kind not just to others who may work with you, but also to future-you.
:::

::: callout-important
## Natural languages \> programming languages

The language you speak is infinitely more intuitive, nuanced, specific, and adaptable. Take advantage of it.

::: callout-warning
## Names should describe the named thing!

Not as easy as it sounds.
:::

-   Avoid disinformation
-   Use pronounceable names
-   Use searchable names
-   Pick one word/format per concept
-   Avoid encodings

# Maintainable

## Function Lifecycles

R is constantly evolving! CRAN uses 4 lifecycle stages for functions:

<table style="width: 80%; font-size: .8em">
<tr style="font-size: 1.2em;">
  <th>Stage</th>
  <th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td style="width: 30%; vertical-align: middle;"><img src="../images/icons/lifecycle/experimental.svg" alt="Experimental" style="height: 2em;"></td>
  <td>
    <ul>
      <li>In development ("beta"), may never reach <em>stable</em></li>
      <li>Can be helpful for specific use-cases</li>
      <li>Use with caution & comments</li>
    </ul>
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td style="vertical-align: middle;"><img src="../images/icons/lifecycle/stable.svg" alt="Stable" style="height: 2em;"></td>
  <td>
    <ul>
      <li>Default stage</li>
      <li>Functional, current, maintained</li>
      <li><strong>Prioritize these!</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td style="vertical-align: middle;"><img src="../images/icons/lifecycle/superseded.svg" alt="Superseded" style="height: 2em;"></td>
  <td>
    <ul>
      <li>Still supported, safe to use</li>
      <li>Better (stable) alternative exists</li>
      <li>Will not be updated, but will not go away</li>
    </ul>
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td style="vertical-align: middle;"><img src="../images/icons/lifecycle/deprecated.svg" alt="Deprecated" style="height: 2em"></td>
  <td>
    <ul>
      <li>Works now but not for long</li>
      <li>Use only as a temporary last resort</li>
      <li>Look for recommended replacements</li>
    </ul>
  </td>
</tr>
</table>


::: notes
If you don't see a lifecycles tag in the CRAN documentation, that means it's stable.\

**Experimental**

-   In development ("beta")
-   May or may not reach stable
-   Can be very helpful for a specific use-case
-   Use with caution
-   Note use in comments in case updates produce errors or collaborators only use stable functions

**Stable**

-   Default stage
-   Functional, current, maintained
-   **Prioritize these!**

**Superseded**

-   Still supported
-   Better (stable) alternative exists
-   Will not be updated, but will not go away
-   Safe to use, but prioritize recommended replacements

**Deprecated**

-   Works now but not for long
-   Use only as a temporary last resort
-   Prioritize recommended replacement

- Variables may need to be combined, anonymized, mutated, etc.
:::
:::

::: col-6

### [⇆  How similar are your data to other data]{style="padding-left:1em;"}

- Will you (or anyone else) conduct a follow-up or replication?
- Do you already know there were problems in data collection that will mean new data format when fixed next time?
- Do other researchers in your area use similar data collection methods but different organization methods?

## DRY Programming

[**D**on't **R**epeat **Y**ourself](https://www.plutora.com/blog/understanding-the-dry-dont-repeat-yourself-principle)

::: container-fluid

::: row
::: col-6

**Avoid**

:::
::: col-6

**Promote**

:::
:::

::: row
::: col-6

- Propagating errors
- Duplication conflicts
- Verbosity hiding small errors

:::
::: col-6

- Replicable, reproducible code
- Abstracted code for multiple contexts
- Code usable by others and future-you

:::
:::

:::


::: notes

-   Avoid copy/paste programming within your own code

Avoid:
Propagating mistakes that must be corrected individually
Duplication conflicts
Combing through verbose scripts for minor errors

Promote:
Replicable, reproducible code
Abstracting code to use in multiple contexts
Code usable by and relevant to other people and future-you

:::

## Caveat: Non-evil Copy/Paste

When *should* you copy and paste?

-   [Forking]{.keyword}: purposefully creating variants for exploration
-   [Templates]{.keyword}: starting points for new projects
-   [Debugging]{.keyword}: temporary workarounds to identify specific problems
-   ["Clone and own"]{.keyword}: adapt foundational code to new contexts

::: notes
copy-and-paste coding is bad, but there's nothing wrong with copying and pasting code in principle.
When should you copy and paste?

purposefully creating variants for exploration
don't reinvent the wheel for the sake of originality
temporary workarounds
copy foundational code and adapt to specific contexts

:::


## Abstraction

### Absolute vs. Relative Paths

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

## Only works on my computer no matter what
absolute_path <- "Users/Natalie/repos/d2mr/example-repo/images/barplot.jpg"

# Works on your machine if you clone it to this location on your computer
mixed_path <- "~/repos/d2mr/example-repo/images/barplot.jpg"

# Works when you clone the repo anywhere
relative_path <- "/images/barplot.jpg"

```

### Hard-coded vs. Dynamic Variables

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

# Always equals 3
my_mean <- (2 + 4)/2

# Output will change to reflect changes to 2 input variables
x <- 2; y <- 4 # or...
# x <- 3; y <- 10
the_mean <- (x + y)/2

# Output will change no matter how many input numerals are averaged
number_list <- c(2,3) # or...
# number_list <- 2:8 # or...
# number_list <- c(1,2,8,100)
a_mean <- sum(number_list)/length(number_list)

```


::: notes
Abstracted (relative) paths and variables are more durable than hard-coded (absolute) ones

# Contextualized

## Community standards

- [R Conventions](https://bookdown.org/yih_huynh/Guide-to-R-Book/r-conventions.html) (for everyone)
- [R Developer Community Culture](https://journal.r-project.org/articles/RJ-2021-110/)
- Find your communities and respect their rules.
    - Gatekeep-y? Admittedly, yes, but that's not the goal
    - Facilitate communication, collaboration, and shared ownership

::: notes
Find your communities (plural) and do your best to respect their rules. This isn’t so much about gatekeeping and in-grouping (though it can certainty feel that way). It’s more about promoting collaboration. When everyone talks about their work in a similar way – whether it’s using the same style guide, preferring certain plots for certain analyses, opting for one package or another, formatting example random data, whatever – it’s much easier to work in forked repos, respond to crowd-sourced questions, understand others’ presentations, and just generally work together toward shared intentions.

"little" as in the commits themselves are little changes

Use a .gitignore to specify files and filetypes that should not be included in pulls or pushes
Maintain a README.md file providing at least minimal documentation of the structure of your repo and purpose of the project
Make purposeful and wise decisions about managing public, private, and protected data and files 
Use informative commit messages
Pull before you start editing; commit as you work; push when you close your session

Remember the whole point of github is version control!

Each assignment has a *unique repo.* Each repo is a *unique files.*

*Do not create multiple copies of the same files!!!*

Your repos are the homes of your projects, not a random collection of notes and homework. Keep them organized, future-proof, and collaborator-friendly for contexts beyond this class.

Do not use the visual editor!!

![](../images/icons/priority.png){style="max-height: 3em;"}
:::
:::

:::

:::
:::


::: notes

The visual editor generates a lot of hidden code and formatting that makes your .qmd files difficult to read, troubleshoot, and maintain. This is really critical if you ever want to really fine-tune your formatting or layout. Switching into the visual editor can just break everything without an easy undo to restore what was working.


-   do 1 and only 1 thing
-   have informative & unique names 
-   specify whether to run and what to display when knit
-   be placed at the point they are needed/referenced
-   be (relatively) short – source longer scripts if necessary


 
 
:::

## Chunk Names

Name your chunks to minimize human error. They should be:

- Unique
- Informative
    - `fig-gesture-stacked-bar` not `gesture-graph`
- Conventional (conservative + correct)
    - Avoid: special characters, spaces, underscores
    - Prefer: letters, hyphens, numerals
    
::: {.callout-warning .fragment}

### 1 Chunk 1 Thing

*Unique* and *informative* chunk names depend on each chunk doing *1 and only 1 thing.* Can you explain what the point of the chunk is in 1-3 words? If not, you've probably got 1 chunk doing too many things.

:::

::: notes

- Conventional (conservative + correct)
    - R variables cannot start with a numeral, so even though chunk names legally can, it's better to avoid it. 
    - Don't use underscores or spaces! Even if they "work," they won't *work* work. They'll break in things that can otherwise understand quarto documents but aren't quarto.
    
    1 Chunk ➝ 1 Thing

 Even if you are creating multiple closely related figures (or tables), best practice is to have each figure actually generate (i.e., knit) from its own chunk.
 In the spirit of minimal copy/paste + 1 thing per chunk, consider a figure setup chunk where the "1 thing" it does is lay out all the properties (themes, layers, data filtering, etc.) that are shared by the figures to follow

<h3 style="margin-top:0em">Mutating joins</h3>

#### Description

Mutating joins add columns from y to x, matching observations based on the keys. There are four mutating joins: the inner join, and the three outer joins.

*Inner join*
An inner_join() only keeps observations from x that have a matching key in y.

*[...text omitted...]{style="color: #999"}*

#### Usage

```{.r}
inner_join(
  x,
  y,
  by = NULL,
  copy = FALSE,
  suffix = c(".x", ".y"),
  ...,
  keep = NULL
)

left_join(
  x,
  y,
  by = NULL,
  copy = FALSE,
  suffix = c(".x", ".y"),
  ...,
  keep = NULL
)

::: notes

We'll talk about "packages" next time – but the idea is that they are collections of functions that work together nicely toward similar programming goals.
There are "base R" functions that are built in, but the vast majority of function you'll use come from packages you need to install and load.

Packages must meet certain requirements to be accessible through CRAN, including being fully 100% compatible with current versions of R.
There are lots of excellent, high-quality, well-maintained packages that aren't in the CRAN list!
