# Syllabus

## Expectations & Course Goals


1. **Develop a reproducible and transparent research workflow.** Plan, execute, and document a data analysis project from start to finish including data acquisition, cleaning, analysis, visualization, and reporting.
2. **Practice accountability & time management.** Set realistic goals, create a plan to achieve them, monitor your progress, and adjust as needed.
3. **Engage with your research communities.** Collaborate effectively with peers, contribute to group learning, and seek help when needed.
4. **Develop problem-solving and independent learning skills.** Develop specific strategies for debugging code, troubleshooting errors, asking good questions, and learning new skills independently using the myriad resources available online from R and open-science communities.


::: notes
### D2M-R will give you:

-   A basic knowledge of how to use GitHub, R, RStudio, Quarto/RMarkdown, and the tidyverse packages
-   Strategies for how to identify and resolve bugs in the data-to-manuscript process
-   Supports for establishing and maintaining a workflow within your project
-   Tools to implement your own data analysis and visualization plans

### D2M-R will __*not*__ give you:

-   Comprehensive expertise in any of the tools or packages or depth in packages outside the tidyverse
-   Instructors or classmates who solve your technical problems for you
-   Accountability hand-holding or objectively "correct" ways of working
-   New knowledge of statistics or research design practices
:::

## Course Philosophy

This class is for you. You should come away with:

- Foundational skills that everything else is built on
- Application of those skills designed around your individual priorities, interests, and goals

To get you there, the class is designed around four key principles:

- Standards-based grading
- Multiple pathways to demonstrate course objectives
- Tiered credit for mastery levels
- Individualized plans and pacing

::: notes

This course uses a **standards-based grading** system designed to support your skill development while accommodating diverse backgrounds, interests, and paces of learning. The system is built around the following principles:

- **Standards-based:** Your grade reflects your progress on a set of clearly defined core technical skills, interchangeably referred to as "standards" and "core objectives." 
- **Multiple pathways:** For most standards, you may choose from more structured activities, less structured / group activities, and minimally structured or self-designed small projects. You will show your mastery in smaller assignments and an integrative data project, both of which can be tailored to your interests and developed over the quarter.
- **Tiered credit:** Each standard is scored using a 4 / 5 / 6 point rubric. Higher scores reflect more independent and expansive use of the skill and allow you to reach your grade goals more quickly. Lower grades may be replaced by subsequent higher grades as you develop stronger command of the skills. All three levels represent success, and earning mostly 4s does not preclude getting an A in the class.
- **Individualized:** Beyond mastering technical skills that form the foundation for data analysis in R, you will also earn points for accountability, community engagement, and optional enrichment activities, with many ways to earn credit in each of these categories. There are no top-down deadlines for completing assignments to meet core standards. This structure allows you to set your own priorities based on your individual interests and goals. 
- **No fixed interim deadlines:** You may complete assignments on your own schedule within the quarter, with are some exceptions. There are fixed deadlines for creating and maintaining the schedule itself (the accountability plan), and there are several hard deadlines based around course logistics (e.g., end of quarter submissions, allowances for timely feedback).
- **Planning is part of the grade:** The Accountability & Reflection component ensures that you set a realistic plan and revisit it as your research and other commitments evolve.
- **Early completion is allowed:** You can, in principle, earn all 80 points for core standards mastery and the integrative data project and another 10 points for enrichment early in the quarter. However, you must still maintain an active accountability plan and community engagement throughout the quarter.

:::

## Communication: Other

- Attend office hours to ask questions in person
    -   i.e. don't ask your "quick question" after class
- Notice for absences is not required
- Be cautious about disclosing personal information over email/Slack
- The [student toolkit](https://nrdowling.notion.site/2cc7b904f28d80129ff0c922f3055ef3?v=2d47b904f28d803abe84000c1454c58f&source=copy_link) has a guide to help write emails
    - Pro tip: Don't use chatGPT. It's [super annoying](https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/search/?q=ai+email&cId=923440df-c068-48b5-8d9c-dc6bc4f01dab&iId=ba6d2df2-a367-42b7-a402-fe8f0d1b8df4).


::: notes
- Dr. Dowling's office hours are Thursdays 2-4pm by appointment
    - Appointments are required
- *TA office hours information*
- Call me either Natalie or Dr/Professor Dowling
- You do not need to let us know if you will be missing class
    - But you can reach out if you feel behind due to absences
- Be cautious about disclosing personal information over email/Slack
    - Remember you *never* need to share details about your health!
- Stressed about emails? The [student toolkit](https://nrdowling.notion.site/2cc7b904f28d80129ff0c922f3055ef3?v=2d47b904f28d803abe84000c1454c58f&source=copy_link) has a guide to help you out
    -   Side note: We can tell when you use chatGPT. It really doesn't look good. We'd rather get a kind of weird email from you than one of those "I kindly request" emails.
- **Please do not line up to ask questions at the end of class.**
    - Those "1-minute" questions add up
    - That's what Slack is for
:::
    
## Climate

- View the class climate policy [here](../syllabus/climate.html).
- Basically, just be cool, ok?
- If you have problems with other students or the TA:
    - Contact me first
    - Escalate to [UChicago CARES](https://cares.uchicago.edu/)
- If you have a problem with me:
    - Discuss it with me directly *if you feel comfortable doing so*
    - Bring it to [UChicago CARES](https://cares.uchicago.edu/)
- **You can *always* go to CARES without going through me or anyone else first.**

::: notes
- View the class climate policy [here](../syllabus/climate.html).
- But really just...be cool, ok?
- We will all be kind, respectful, responsive, and supportive to one another in the classroom,
on Slack, and all other interaction.
- If you have problems with other students or the TA:
    - Contact me first (if possible)
    - If we can't resolve it contact [UChicago CARES](https://cares.uchicago.edu/)
- If you have a problem with me
    - Discuss it with me directly *if and only if you feel comfortable doing so*
        - I never want to be the cause of discomfort for anyone! If you have feedback that can help me be a better instructor, I want to hear it.
    - Bring it to [UChicago CARES](https://cares.uchicago.edu/)
- You can *always* go to CARES without going through anyone else first, but my goal is
to create a classroom climate where you feel comfortable talking to me about ways to create
a more welcoming and respectful environment.
:::

## Accessibility & Accommodation


- Requests for formal accommodations should go through Student Disability Services
    - *Graduate students* need to request accommodation letters be sent to me
    - You *never* need to disclose personal details to me or anyone outside SDS
- Meet with me in office hours for informal accommodation requests
    - Note: *All* arrangements must align with SDS policies for equity.
- You will factor your own accommodations into your accountability plan

::: notes
- Requests for formal accommodations should go through Student Disability Services
    - SDS will send *undergraduate* accommodation letters to me automatically
    - *Graduate students* need to ask SDS to send me a letter
    - You *never* need to disclose personal details to me or anyone outside SDS
- If you have an informal request for an accommodation, with me in office hours
    - We can almost always work something out, but we need to follow SDS policies
- After sending your letter, schedule a meeting with me to make an accommodation plan
    - If you do need accommodations, you will factor your accommodation plan into your 
    accountability plan (coming up in a couple slides)
:::

## Disclosing personal information

**You are never required to disclose personal information to me or any instructors.** These guidelines are for all classes at UChicago, not just this one.

You do *not* need to:

- Share details about your health, disability, or reasoning for accommodations
- Get a doctor's note for absences
    - *Your instructor is not allowed to ask for one!*
- Defend your need for accommodations

::: {.alert .alert-warning .fragment}
You are an adult with priorities and the capacity for cost/benefit decision-making. You can decide what you want to share and with whom. If you need to miss class because you have terrible period cramps, are having a panic attack, are recovering from a migraine, think your roommate might have COVID, need to cram for an exam for a different class, are shamefully hung over, or just really don't wanna come to campus, you do not need to explain yourself to me or anyone else. Just take care of yourself, and take responsibility for effects on your learning and grades.

This doesn't mean there are never consequences for missing class. You are responsible for keeping up with the material and assignments (per your accommodations, if applicable), and are subject to penalties defined by the syllabus.
:::

## Academic Integrity: Overview

- View the academic integrity policy [here](../syllabus/ai-policy.html).
- Plagiarism is bad. Cheating is bad. Don't do it.
    - Why are you even here?
- All written/textual content in your submitted assignments must be fully produced by you
- Code may be produced with AI (or human) assistance with a full disclosure statement
- Disclosure statements are required for *all submitted work*, even if you didn't use AI
    - AI disclosure statement is included in the assessment document submitted with all assignments

## Academic Integrity: Grading Penalties

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
You will *not* be penalized for (with disclosure):

- Using AI to help you with *code*
- Using code snippets from print or online resources
- Co-writing *code* with classmates/other humans
- Unintentionally crossing the line with AI *if it is fully disclosed*
    - I will ask to you revise and resubmit without penalty

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

You *will* be penalized for:

- Failing to disclose any of the above
- Using AI to generate *text* for ANY submitted work
- Using *text* written by any human other than you, including classmates
    - Exceptions for some group projects may be granted, but must be requested in advance
:::
:::

<span style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bolder;">Submissions that do not follow these guidelines will receive a non-negotiable 0.</span>

## Academic Integrity: You & AI

You should only be taking this class if you want to gain practical skills that will be useful to you outside of the class. 

Hopefully you are using the class to make progress on a research project you are invested in. If you do not use AI wisely, you may not be "cheating" in a way that will hurt your grade, but you will be cheating yourself out of the reason you joined the class. If you don't care enough to actually learn the material yourself, this probably isn't the right class for you.

You can read my [guide](d2m-r.github.io/syllabus/ai-policy.html) for what I personally believe are ethical and constructive uses of AI
in higher education.

# Assessment & Grading

## Grading Overview

Earn up to 100 points across five categories:

| Points | Category | Description |
| ----- | ---------- | ---------------|
| 10 | [Accountability](../assessment/accountability.html) | Create and maintain a personalized accountability plan |
| 10 | [Community Engagement](../assessment/engagement.html) | Participate actively in class and on Slack |
| 60 | [Core Standards Mastery](../assessment/objectives.html) | Demonstrate proficiency on 12 core technical skills (standards) |
| 20 | [Integrative Data Project](../assessment/data-project.html) | Complete a comprehensive data analysis project demonstrating mastery of all core standards |
| *((10))* | [Enrichment](../assessment/enrichment.html) | Optional activities to deepen learning and supplement core work |

Because enrichment points are optional, it is possible to earn more than 100 raw points across categories. Final course grades are capped at 100.

::: {.alert .alert-info}
You start at 0 points and work up to 100. You don't start at 100 and lose points. Meeting minimum requirements means you will pass the class. Earning an A takes more than that.
:::


## Accountability Plan (10pt)

- **You create an assignment schedule for yourself.** 
    - Defining your own goals is part of the research workflow
    - This is part of *an explicit learning objective* and part of your grade
- You will create a personal timeline and accountability plan for the quarter
    - Checkpoints on Mondays of Weeks 2, 5, and 8
- Optionally: Base your plan on the suggested timeline in the [assignment instructions](../assessment/accountability.html)
    - This is not supposed to feel overwhelming, so take advantage of this if it helps! 
- SDS approved accommodations for extensions are built into your plan
- **10%** of your final grade is based on your accountability plan, including:
    - Meeting the 3 checkpoint deadlines for the plan itself (meta-deadlines)
    - Meeting the deadlines you set for yourself
    - Reflecting on your progress and making adjustments
    - *Suggesting* a grade (of 10)

::: notes

- **No fixed interim deadlines:** You may complete assignments on your own schedule within the quarter, with are some exceptions. There are fixed deadlines for creating and maintaining the schedule itself (the accountability plan), and there are several hard deadlines based around course logistics (e.g., end of quarter submissions, allowances for timely feedback).
- **Planning is part of the grade:** The Accountability & Reflection component ensures that you set a realistic plan and revisit it as your research and other commitments evolve.
- **Early completion is allowed:** You can, in principle, earn all 80 points for core standards mastery and the integrative data project and another 10 points for enrichment early in the quarter. However, you must still maintain an active accountability plan and community engagement throughout the quarter.

- **You create an assignment schedule for yourself.** With very few exceptions, there are no top-down deadlines in this class. Why?
    - This class is about developing and maintaining a research workflow
    - A major part of that is learning how to set and meet your own deadlines
    - Making your own plan and sticking to it *is part of the syllabus*
        - This means that "reasonable accommodations" must not prevent you from reaching this objective
- You will create a personal timeline and accountability plan for the quarter
    - Initial plans are due by Monday of Week 2
    - Revised plans and reflections are due by Monday of Week 5
    - Final reflections are due Monday of Week 8
- You can base your plan on the suggested timeline in the [assignment instructions]()
    - Use the suggested plan without changes (great option of the idea of designing your own schedule feels overwhelming)
    - Start with this plan and make adjustments
    - Start from scratch!
- If your SDS accommodations include extended deadlines, you will factor those into the plan
    - i.e. We are using this plan to agree on extensions now. I will not grant extensions to the
    planned extensions as we go.
- **10%** of your final grade is based on your accountability plan, including:
    - Meeting the actual deadlines that I have set for the plan itself
    - Meeting the deadlines you set for yourself
    - Reflecting on your progress and making adjustments to your plan
    - *Suggesting* a grade (of 10) for how well you think you followed your plan
:::


## Community Engagement (10pt)

Attending class and paying attention are basic expectations.
Your engagement grade is based on how you show investment in the course and your peers, both in and out of class. Some ways to do this include:

- In-class:
    - Ask and answer questions during lecture
    - Use workshop time wisely and generously
    - Participate in group activities
- Outside the classroom:
    - Be an active participant on Slack
    - Seek support from peers and instructors when needed
    - Collaborate with peers
    - Complete collaborative assignments

::: notes
Aside from the basic expectation that you'll attend class and pay attention, this can look different for everyone. The community engagement grade is not about meeting the minimum requirement (e.g., attending class!). It's about demonstrating a high level of investment in the course and your peers. **This is not an attendance grade.**

Here's a non-exhaustive list of things that can contribute to the community engagement grade:

1.  In-classroom:
    - Make active contributions in a large group setting by asking/answering questions during lecture
    - Use workshop time wisely and generously, seeking and offering support from/to classmates with debugging and troubleshooting
    - Participating in group activities
    - Generally paying attention and staying focused during class time
2.  Outside the classroom:
    -  Be an active participant on the class Slack channel, both asking and answering questions
    -  Get support from classmates, TAs, and the professor
    -  Team up with a partner or small group to meet for working groups outside of class
    -  Take on one or more of the optional collaborative assignments in the assessment menu
:::

## Core Standards Mastery (60pt)

Each standard is scored on a 4 / 5 / 6 point scale based on the quality and independence of your demonstration of the skill. 

| Points | Label | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *No grade* | *No demonstration* | *You have not yet demonstrated this skill.* |
| **4** | **Meets Expectations** | You demonstrate the skill correctly in structured or familiar contexts. |
| **5** | **Exceeds Expectations** | You apply the skill correctly and independently in a novel context. |
| **6** | **Outstanding** | You use the skill in an especially expansive way. |



::: notes

Each standard is scored on a 4 / 5 / 6 point scale based on the quality and independence of your demonstration of the skill. 

| Points | Label | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *No grade* | *No demonstration* | *You have not yet demonstrated this skill.* |
| **4** | **Meets Expectations** | You demonstrate the skill correctly in structured or familiar contexts (for example, following a guided assignment or closely modeled example). |
| **5** | **Exceeds Expectations** | You apply the skill correctly and independently in a novel context, with clear, well-chosen code that would generalize to new datasets or problems. |
| **6** | **Outstanding** | You use the skill in an especially expansive way: combining it with other skills, applying 
it to a complex or less-structured task, or going beyond the scope of in-class examples. |

All three levels (4, 5, 6) are successful demonstrations. If you do not demonstrate a skill at least at the 4-point level, you will not earn credit for that standard.

Earning an average of 5 points per standard will earn you all 60 points. An average lower than 5 points can still result in an 'A' grade for the class if you complete [enrichment activities](../assessment/enrichment.html).

Each assignment will receive a score for each standard it addresses based on this rubric.
Individual assignments may not be resubmitted for a higher score, but you may improve your score for a standard by submitting new assignments that demonstrate that standard at a higher level.

*Higher scores always replace lower scores for core standards*, so after earning a high score with an impressive assignment, subsequent assignments that use the skill at a more basic level won't lower your score.


:::

## Integrative Data Project (20pt)

The final project is a data analysis report created with RStudio and maintained in a GitHub repo that includes:

- Data import
- Data wrangling/cleaning
- Basic descriptive statistics
- Simple data visualization
- Narrative markdown text explaining your choices and findings

## Integrative Data Project (20pt)

Earn up to 20 points on the data project:

| Points | Component | Description |
| ------ | --------- | ----------- |
| 12 | Core standards | Demonstrate all 12 core standards at 4pt-level or above |
| 2 | Reproducibility | Code is fully reproducible, with no errors |
| 2 | Documentation | Code is clearly commented with explanatory Quarto narrative text |
| 2 | Cohesion | Data wrangling, statistics, and plots are clearly connected with narrative text|
| 2 | Presentation | Quarto document is well-formatted and knits without error |

Submit your data project **up to 3 times** to get early feedback and/or complete the requirement early.

::: notes

"Above and beyond" demonstrations of core standards or exceptional quality may receive bonus points at the grader's discretion, but the project cannot contribute more than 20 points to the final grade. In other words, outstanding use of one standard might earn you a point that compensates for weaker presentation or documentation, but not a point of extra credit.

You may submit the data project up to 3 times throughout the quarter.
With each draft, you will also include a self-assessment, indicating which standards you believe you have demonstrated and how well you have met each of the grading components above.
After scoring your work, your grader will provide feedback as a response to your self-assessment to help you improve your project for future submissions.

You are allowed -- *and encouraged!* -- to submit partial drafts of your project to confirm that you are on the right track before submitting a full draft.
You aren't expected to be able to demonstrate a skill before we cover it in class, so early submissions may only demonstrate a subset of the standards.
That's fine! 
Submitting a draft that shows only a few objectives will let you confirm that you are in fact meeting expectations for those objectives and will give you guidance on where to go next.

Grades for resubmissions will replace previous scores. Your grade for the data project will be the score earned on your last submission before the end-of-quarter deadline.

## Enrichment (up to 10pt)

These 10 optional points are a way for you to customize your curriculum in this class to your own interests and goals.

You can earn 100 points without any enrichment points, but you can make up for lower scores on core standards by completing enrichment activities.

Examples include:

- Debugging journals that document how you worked through specific problems
- Short write‑ups teaching a peer how to do something (e.g., connecting RStudio and GitHub)
- Reflections on responsible and productive use of AI tools in your workflow
- Evidence of sustained collaboration on GitHub (e.g., issues, pull requests, code review)
- Contributions to open‑source R packages or communities (e.g., GitHub issues, Stack Overflow answers)

### Where do I find them?

For the most part it's up to you to design your own enrichment activities.
Figuring out for yourself what would be most useful for your own learning is part of the point of this category.
If you are totally lost as to where to start, there are a few unstructured activities listed on the assignment menu.

::: notes

Enrichment activities are **not** part of the base structure of the course grade. 
Instead, they give you a way to recover or add points if you choose a more structured path or if some standards land at the 4‑point level.

This is effectively up to 10 points of extra credit, but I don't like thinking about these skills or these kinds of experiences as "extra."
I believe this category is as valuable as the core skills, but necessarily fuzzier and more open-ended.
These 10 optional points are a way for you to customize your curriculum in this class to your own interests and goals.

Examples include:

- Debugging journals that document how you worked through specific problems
- Short write‑ups teaching a peer how to do something (e.g., connecting RStudio and GitHub)
- Simple documentation for your own utility functions
- Reflections on responsible and productive use of AI tools in your workflow
- Evidence of sustained collaboration on GitHub (e.g., issues, pull requests, code review)
- Short explorations of advanced R packages or techniques beyond the core curriculum
- Identifying a need in your own research workflow and designing a solution using R
- Discovering and effectively making use of specialized R packages for your specific needs
- Mini‑projects that apply course skills to your own research questions (must be different from your final data project)
- Contributions to open‑source R packages or communities (e.g., GitHub issues, Stack Overflow answers)

This is not a comprehensive list, and really the more creative and customized you approach this, the more useful it will be for your own learning (and the easier it will be to earn points). If you have an idea for an enrichment activity that isn't listed here, send an email to Dr. Dowling to confirm that it is appropriate before you start working on it.

You may submit evidence for enrichment points up to 5 times during the quarter.
Evidence may be in the form of a dedicated project (e.g., a debugging journal) or as a companion to another assignment (e.g., writing up how you used AI tools to help solve a problem in a core standards assignment).
Points will be awarded based on overall quality and depth, which may look like creativity, independent learning, clear communication, thoughtful self-evaluation, or other dimensions depending on the nature of the activity.
Your submission will include an opportunity for you to explain how the activity contributed to your learning and how many points you believe you have earned.

The Canvas assignments include details on exactly how to submit and document different kinds of demonstrations.
