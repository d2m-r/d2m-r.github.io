## Materials

### Slides

**Slides** will typically be posted on Mondays and remain accessible through the end of the academic year.
Links in the course calendar below will take you directly to the web presentation version of the slides.

You can alternatively find the Quarto files in the [website's repo](https://github.com/d2m-r/d2m-r.github.io/tree/main/slides), which include additional details and notes not visible in the presentation format.

### Readings

**D2M-R textbook chapters** correspond to subjects in the textbook that goes with this class.
This book is very much in development, with large portions entirely untouched as of the start of the quarter.
Where relevant chapters are missing or incomplete, readings from external sources like [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) will be assigned instead. 

**You can contribute to any unfinished sections of the textbook for course credit!** See the [student hub documents](https://github.com/d2m-r/student-hub/blob/main/project-documents/other/contribution-textbook.md) for textbook contributions for details.
