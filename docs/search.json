    "text": "Academic integrity has become inextricably linked with artificial intelligence in the classroom, but they are not equivalent. AI tools are not inherently unethical, nor are they inherently ethical. They can be used to cheat, but they can also be used to learn. They can be used to misrepresent, but they can also be used to clarify. They can be used to plagiarize, but they can also be used to create.\nThis policy outlines what will count as cheating in this class and offers suggestions for how to use LLMs constructively. It is not exhaustive, and it is not a substitute for your own judgment. If you are ever unsure whether a particular use of AI is appropriate, ask me.\nStudents in this course are expected to follow UChicago’s Academic Honesty & Plagiarism policy. To add clarity to this general policy, in this class I am using Oxford University’s explanation of plagiarism:\n\nPlagiarism is presenting work or ideas from another source as your own, with or without consent of the original author, by incorporating it into your work without full acknowledgement. All published and unpublished material, whether in manuscript, printed or electronic form, is covered under this definition, as is the use of material generated wholly or in part through use of artificial intelligence (save when use of Artificial Intelligence - AI for assessment has received prior authorisation e.g. as a reasonable adjustment for a student’s disability). Plagiarism can also include re-using your own work without citation.\n\nIn Data to Manuscript in R, you may use AI tools for coding, but not for writing. This means you may use AI to generate and revise code without penalty.\nYou may not submit any AI-generated written work, including but not limited to:\n\nWritten responses to questions in assignments\nNarrative text of your data project\nProject reflections\nAI statements1\n\n“AI-generated written work” includes using AI to generate text that you then revise or edit.\n\nPlagiarized written work, whether from human or AI creators, will receive a non-negotiable 0."

    "text": "Ethical AI Use\nThe relationship between AI and plagiarism is complicated, to put it mildly. ChatGPT doesn’t care if you plagiarize it. Bard’s career isn’t going to suffer if you benefit from its work without giving due credit. Dall-E doesn’t have artistic integrity. It doesn’t matter to AI, but it should matter to you.\nThe work you produce as a student is a representation of you. It not only demonstrates the skills you’ve gained in your education, it is often the only “you” some professors, employers, and peers will know before making important judgments and decisions that directly affect you. If you, for example, apply to a PhD program with a writing sample and personal statement that someone or something else wrote, you will be expected to produce comparable intellectual contributions on the spot at interviews and throughout your career.\nThis kind of misrepresentation cuts both ways. AI seems extraordinarily intelligent and capable, but it is not nearly as smart and capable as you are when it comes to telling the difference between reality and fantasy. You may be prone to human error, less-than-perfect writing, or other academic struggles, but AI is prone to hallucinations. It asserts completely inaccurate things with extreme confidence. When you claim AI’s work as your own, you are taking ownership over any inaccurate, confusing, bizarre, offensive, or otherwise problematic material it has created.\nI believe AI can be used ethically, but I caution you to give serious thought to whether and how you choose to use it, apart from whether and how you are permitted to do so. The ethical complications of AI extend well beyond plagiarism and misrepresentation concerns; any use of large language models will have global consequences. It is your responsibility to weigh the risks and benefits with regard to your personal use, within the bounds of what is explicitly allowed.\nLLMs are actively harming the environment and exploiting workers, in both cases disproportionately so in low-income and already exploited regions. These models perpetuate racist and classist societal bias and misrepresent non-Western cultures. We as users are complicit, whether or not we hold these biases ourselves."

    "text": "Constructive AI Use\nLarge language models aren’t the first technological breakthrough to revolutionize learning. Graphing calculators allow you to tackle more complex problems in calculus. R, Stata, and SPSS allow us to apply statistical analyses and visualize data rapidly and reliably. Spell check and tools like Grammarly2 can make your writing process more efficient. Citations managers like Zotero let you spend more time on reading and analyzing materials and less time poring over style guides.\nBut a graphing calculator won’t do your homework if you don’t know enough calculus to make use of it. RStudio won’t give you anything to work with unless you understand how the programming language works and have a solid grasp on how to select and apply analyses. Spelling and grammar checkers are notorious for making bizarre, decontextualized, and flat out incorrect suggestions that you need to be able to identify and manually fix. Zotero can’t produce a comprehensive and accurate References section if you don’t maintain your database consistently.\nSimilarly, ChatGPT can’t produce quality (or accurate, reliable, or relevant) content if you don’t have the foundational skills to create effective prompts. The most constructive way to use LLM tools will depend on what you the user are bringing to the “conversation.”\nYou shouldn’t use AI to cheat yourself out of an education or set yourself up for failure. Don’t use AI-generated content for anything you couldn’t generate yourself. Instead, use AI to help you learn the material and get to the point where you can do it yourself (and so can make constructive use of AI-generated shortcuts). Use it to break down a dense passage in a reading. Ask it the questions you’d rather not bring up in class.\nYou can find some concrete examples of how to constructively use AI in different contexts in the section Learning Tools vs. Content Generators below."

    "title": "AI & Academic Integrity Policy",
    "section": "Tips, Tricks, and Strategies",
    "text": "Tips, Tricks, and Strategies\nSo in practice, what exactly are you literally supposed to do?\nFirst and foremost, when an instructor has explicitly stated what uses of AI are and are not allowed in their class, that’s how you should and shouldn’t use AI in that class. Full stop.\nWhen there’s no explicit statement, it’s up to you to rely on your common sense and integrity. This section has some general guidelines and rules of thumb for how to approach this.\n\nSuggested Appropriate and Constructive Uses of AI Writing and Coding Tools\n\nComing up with a title for your paper\nFinding alternative wording for a specific idea you are struggling to articulate\nMaking your writing more concise\nBrainstorming topics and research questions\nCreating a list of important researchers in your topic area to start looking for sources\nProofreading and copy-editing your full drafts\nGenerating base-level code to correct and develop (akin to the kind of responses you’d get on Stack Overflow)\nPerforming a preliminary translation between natural or programming languages with short blocks of text or code\n\nEven in these cases, you should be careful to critically evaluate the output and make sure it is accurate and representative of what you’re intending to communicate. LLMs are particularly bad at making good judgments about what is important to keep and ok to lose when it comes to making your writing more concise. It definitely can help with that, but you have to give it a lot of guidance to keep it focused on cutting unnecessary content only.\n\n\nTreat AI Like a Person\nIt is unethical and plagiaristic to claim the ideas and writing of another entity–including digital entities like ChatGPT–are your own. There is admittedly a fine line between using a phrase or wording suggestion produced by AI and using so much generated text as to constitute plagiarism. To figure out which side of the line you’re on in a given situation, pretend that ChatGPT is a person.\nAsk yourself: If this work was created by a human…\n\nHow would you cite it?\n\nIf you’re using a phrasing suggestion that you might find in any written work, general knowledge facts you asked AI to retrieve, or anything else that you could access in many other ways, that’s probably ok to use.\nIf you would cite the source as a direct (with quotation marks and in-text citation) or indirect (paraphrased and in-text citation) quote, you should account for it. You might directly quote a human source if you are using narrowly defined text or using a large chunk of text. In this case, if you do use the quote you should cite it according to your style guide’s recommendations. See the APA guidelines here. The better option is to figure out where AI got the idea from in the first place, then go read that source and cite it directly.\n\nWould you copy and paste it?\n\nFor written text: If you want to include so much text from an LLM source that you’d copy and paste it into your document, you need to treat it like a direct quote. At that point it’s not just helping you write, it’s doing it for you. If you aren’t quite sure whether it’s too much text to use without citing the AI, type it out yourself rather than copying and pasting. If the idea of typing out that much seems silly, it’s probably inappropriate to use it.\nFor coding/programming: Because programming is, well, programmatic, there’s not a lot of variation between efficient code written by different humans for relatively simple tasks. It’s common and ethical practice to reuse your own old code. It’s also usually ok to copy-paste code from publicly available learning and development resources (e.g., the Cookbook for R) or from crowd-sourced sites (e.g., Stack Overflow). It’s not ok to find someone else’s script on GitHub and present it as your own work without proper citation. Applying these rules to AI, it’s probably ok to ask ChatGPT to write a function for you to do a specific task or a block of code to address a specific issue you’re stuck on. It’s probably not ok to generate a full, complex script without proper citation. It’s definitely not ok to do so for class assignments. (This is a point about ethical use only. There’s more about constructive AI use for programming below.)\n\nWould you trust it?\n\nYou wouldn’t (or at least shouldn’t) take just any human-generated writing as perfectly accurate, unbiased, or fully informed. Before referencing any work, you would (should) check the credentials of the individual and/or publication, fact-check claims on topics you’re not an expert on, and think critically about whether/how these ideas fit into the wider literature and big-picture concepts.\nMaybe this will change in years to come, but right now in 2025 AI-generated writing is typically less accurate, more biased, and less informed compared to human-generated writing. Don’t give it any undue credit or benefit of the doubt!\n\n\n\n\nLearning Tools vs. Content Generators\nAssess your own knowledge and experience in any given context to decide whether AI should be a tool to improve your efficiency (like a calculator, programming language, or citation manager) or a tool to facilitate learning.\n\nWhat do you want?\nUltimately it’s up to you do decide what “constructive” use of AI means to you. It’s up to you to decide whether you even care that you use AI constructively. As you’re figuring it out, reflect on this question: Why are you here and not somewhere else?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipWhy are you here and not somewhere else?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s a UChicago Booth unofficial motto (which may not be the absolute best place to find your personal guiding ethics), but the question is worth asking wherever you find yourself. If you want to use AI to get ahead, great! But what does “getting ahead” actually mean? Why are you putting your valuable time, energy, and money into your education? What do you want out of this experience? How can you use AI to not just arbitrarily “get ahead,” but to move toward the places you personally want to go?\nYou have chosen to dedicate your precious financial, emotional, and cognitive resources to earning your UChicago degree, a piece of paper that is only meaningful if it is symbolic of the knowledge you gained and produced. An unearned degree may (or may not) get you a job, but it will not sustain your success. Reliance on LLMs can make you less creative and lead to decreased long-term neural and cognitive function.\nEven if you view your education as purely transactional, consider that using AI may damage your chances on the job market. When you claim AI’s work as your own, you are taking ownership of its bullshit and risking reputational consequences.\n\n\nI suggest really giving some thought to what “constructive” AI use means to you. Imagine yourself using ChatGPT in different ways in different contexts. Which ones are worth it?"

The system is built around the following principles:\n\nStandards-based: Your grade reflects your progress on a set of clearly defined core technical skills.\nMultiple pathways: You may choose from a “menu” of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured activities to demonstrate mastery of each standard, opting to complete the ones you feel will be most useful to you.\nTiered credit: Each standard is scored using a 4 / 5 / 6 point rubric. All three levels represent success, and earning mostly 4s does not preclude getting an A in the class.\nIndividualized: Beyond mastering technical skills, you will also earn points for accountability, community engagement, and optional enrichment activities.\n\n\n\nSelf‑Pacing, Deadlines, and Workflow\n\nNo fixed interim deadlines: You may complete nearly all assignments on your own schedule within the quarter, with a few specific exceptions.\nPlanning is part of the grade: The Accountability & Reflection component ensures that you set a realistic plan and revisit it as your research and other commitments evolve.\nEarly completion is allowed: You can earn all 80 points for core standards mastery and the integrative data project and another 10 points for enrichment at any point during the quarter.\n\n\n\nGrade Breakdown\nEarn up to 100 points across five categories:\n\n\n\nPoints\nCategory\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n10\nAccountability\nCreate and maintain a personalized accountability plan\n\n\n10\nCommunity Engagement\nParticipate actively in class and on Slack\n\n\n60\nCore Standards Mastery\nDemonstrate proficiency on 12 core technical skills (standards)\n\n\n20\nIntegrative Data Project\nComplete a comprehensive data analysis project demonstrating mastery of all core standards\n\n\n((10))\nEnrichment\nOptional activities to deepen learning and supplement core work\n\n\n\nBecause enrichment points are optional, it is possible to earn more than 100 raw points across categories.

You can pass a character vector to a stringr function, and it will operate on each element of the vector automatically, returning a vector of results. In contrast, many base R string functions are not vectorized and require additional steps to apply them to each element of a character vector."

Since there is no pattern matching in this kind of extraction, there is no pattern to come first, so the string to search comes first. This is perfectly reasonable, but it can be confusing when you are used to the pattern-first convention of other string functions. In contrast, str_sub() follows the consistent structure of string as first argument. This consistency in argument order helps reduce confusion and makes it easier to remember how to use different functions within the stringr package. It also makes all stringr functions play nice in pipelines, where the result of one line is implicitly the first argument of the next.\nCoding challenge:\nUse regex, str_glue, and str_sub to detect the first occurrence of an animal and of an adjective in the sentence, extract them, and create a new string with them. For example, if the sentence is “The QUICK brown fox jumps over the LAZY dog.”, you could extract “fox” (animal) and “QUICK” (adjective) and create a new string like “Look at the QUICK fox!”\nR doesn’t know what “fox” or “LAZY” mean, so you’ll need to define what counts as an animal and an adjective for this challenge. The simplest way to do this is just to name the words directly in a vector or within the regex pattern, but you can try for a more adaptable or creative definition if you want to make it more interesting!\nChallengier:\nCreate a function that lets your user decide whether the resulting sentence should use the first or second occurrence of the animal and adjective. For example, if the user chooses “first”, the function would extract “QUICK” and “fox” to create “Look at the QUICK fox!”, but if they choose “second”, it would extract “LAZY” and “dog” to create “Look at the LAZY dog!”.\nYet even more challengier:\nAllow your user to specify first animal and second adjective (or vice versa), or to specify a different sentence to analyze. Make sure your function can handle cases where the specified occurrence doesn’t exist (e.g., if the user asks for the second animal but there is only one animal in the sentence) and provide informative error messages."

The system is built around the following principles:\n\nStandards-based: Your grade reflects your progress on a set of clearly defined core technical skills, interchangeably referred to as “standards” and “core objectives.”\nMultiple pathways: For most standards, you may choose from more structured activities, less structured / group activities, and minimally structured or self-designed small projects. You will show your mastery in smaller assignments and an integrative data project, both of which can be tailored to your interests and developed over the quarter.\nTiered credit: Each standard is scored using a 4 / 5 / 6 point rubric. Higher scores reflect more independent and expansive use of the skill and allow you to reach your grade goals more quickly. Lower grades may be replaced by subsequent higher grades as you develop stronger command of the skills. All three levels represent success, and earning mostly 4s does not preclude getting an A in the class.\nIndividualized: Beyond mastering technical skills that form the foundation for data analysis in R, you will also earn points for accountability, community engagement, and optional enrichment activities, with many ways to earn credit in each of these categories. There are no top-down deadlines for completing assignments to meet core standards. This structure allows you to set your own priorities based on your individual interests and goals.\nNo fixed interim deadlines: You may complete assignments on your own schedule within the quarter, with are some exceptions. There are fixed deadlines for creating and maintaining the schedule itself (the accountability plan), and there are several hard deadlines based around course logistics (e.g., end of quarter submissions, allowances for timely feedback).\nPlanning is part of the grade: The Accountability & Reflection component ensures that you set a realistic plan and revisit it as your research and other commitments evolve.\nEarly completion is allowed: You can, in principle, earn all 80 points for core standards mastery and the integrative data project and another 10 points for enrichment early in the quarter. However, you must still maintain an active accountability plan and community engagement throughout the quarter."

You aren’t expected to be able to demonstrate a skill before we cover it in class, so early submissions may only demonstrate a subset of the standards. That’s fine!

Figuring out for yourself what would be most useful for your own learning is part of the point of this category. If you are totally lost as to where to start, there are a few unstructured activities available in the student-hub repo.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnrichment activities are not part of the base structure of the course grade. Instead, they give you a way to recover or add points if you choose a more structured path or if some standards land at the 4‑point level.\nThis is effectively up to 10 points of extra credit, but I don’t like thinking about these skills or these kinds of experiences as “extra.” I believe this category is as valuable as the core skills, but necessarily fuzzier and more open-ended. These 10 optional points are a way for you to customize your curriculum in this class to your own interests and goals.\nExamples include:\n\nDebugging journals that document how you worked through specific problems\nShort write‑ups teaching a peer how to do something (e.g., connecting RStudio and GitHub)\nSimple documentation for your own utility functions\nReflections on responsible and productive use of AI tools in your workflow\nEvidence of sustained collaboration on GitHub (e.g., issues, pull requests, code review)\nShort explorations of advanced R packages or techniques beyond the core curriculum\nIdentifying a need in your own research workflow and designing a solution using R\nDiscovering and effectively making use of specialized R packages for your specific needs\nMini‑projects that apply course skills to your own research questions (must be different from your final data project)\nContributions to open‑source R packages or communities (e.g., GitHub issues, Stack Overflow answers)\n\nThis is not a comprehensive list, and really the more creative and customized you approach this, the more useful it will be for your own learning (and the easier it will be to earn points). If you have an idea for an enrichment activity that isn’t listed here, send an email to Dr. Dowling to confirm that it is appropriate before you start working on it.\nYou may submit evidence for enrichment points up to 5 times during the quarter. Evidence may be in the form of a dedicated project (e.g., a debugging journal) or as a companion to another assignment (e.g., writing up how you used AI tools to help solve a problem in a core standards assignment). Points will be awarded based on overall quality and depth, which may look like creativity, independent learning, clear communication, thoughtful self-evaluation, or other dimensions depending on the nature of the activity. Your submission will include an opportunity for you to explain how the activity contributed to your learning and how many points you believe you have earned."

All vectors must be of equal length (i.e., same number of rows), but they can be different data types across vectors (e.g., one column can be numeric, another character, etc.). Within a single vector (column), all elements must be of the same data type.\nTibbles are the tidyverse’s alternative to data frames. Tibbles are also data frames. It’s just another class applied to the same object. There are several important technical advantages to tibbles, but for our applied purposes all that you need to know is that tidyverse functions generally expect tibbles as inputs and return tibbles as outputs. So when working in the tidyverse, you’ll mostly be using tibbles. Conceptually, they’re going to be interchangeable with data frames."

    "text": "Packages: Install & Load\n\n\nTo use functions from a package, you must first:\n\nInstall the package on your local machine\n\ninstall.packages(\"packagename\")\nInstall a package once (on each machine)\n\nLoad (aka attach) it into your R session\n\nlibrary(packagename) or require(packagename)\nLoad a package each time you start a new R session\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoading vs attaching\n\n\nCalling library() on a package makes its functions available for use as though they were built into R itself. We usually call this loading the package, but technically it’s attaching it.\nOnce a package is installed on your machine, you can load functions directly without attaching the whole package with library(). Do so by prefixing the function with the name of the package and two colors: packagename::functionname().\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso: 1. use library() in scripts; require() is more for using in functions 2. in addition to loading packages with each new session, good practice to also load packages at the start of each script that uses them 3. package loading order matters! loading a package with a function that has the same name as a function in an already loaded package will override the definition of that function (but you can still call the old one with packagename::functionname())\ninstall.package(\"tidyverse\") – install a package on your local machine library(tidyverse) – load an existing package require(tidyverse) and Require(\"tidyverse\") - require a package Try those requires out and compare… Not working? try typing ??Require into the console (note the 2 question marks) and see if you can figure out what’s going on and how to fix it. Installing/loading some packages will also install/load dependencies e.g., library(tidyverse) will load the included readr package readr will also load dependencies DBI, haven, readxl, and others\nHaving trouble? Review the troubleshooting strategies from first week! Most packages have full documentation on CRAN Alternatively on the package’s GitHub repo or developer site See documentation for functions within RStudio by typing ?thefunctioname into the console"

The former package depends on the latter, its dependency.\n\n\nA package’s CRAN documentation will list its dependencies in three categories:\n\nDepends: Packages that must be installed and attached for the package to work\nImports: Packages that must be installed (but not attached) for the package to work\nSuggests: Packages that are not required for the package to work, but are recommended for full functionality\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn practice…\n\n\nWhen you install or load a package, R will automatically install or load its Depends and Imports dependencies for you. Usually this will just happen without you needing to even notice, but occasionally you may be prompted by the console to approve the installation/loading of dependencies. Rarely, you may need to manually install or load a dependency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe same way that package functions are built using base R functions, packages also frequently (usually) build on functions from other packages. When a package uses functions from another package, that other package is its dependency.\nThere are two big categories of dependencies, hard and soft dependencies. Hard dependencies are required. Functions in the package simply won’t work without them. Soft dependencies are recommended to get the most out of the package, but not strictly necessary. We’ve got three flavors of dependencies in R:\n\nDepends: Packages that must be installed and attached for the package to work\nImports: Packages that must be installed (but not attached) for the package to work\nSuggests: Packages that are not required for the package to work, but are recommended for full functionality"

It is generally faster for large datasets but can be less strict about data types.\nThe if_else() function is part of the dplyr package in the tidyverse. It is also vectorized but is stricter about data types, ensuring that the output type matches the input type. This can help prevent unexpected results when working with different data types."

Imagine R is humming along, reading your string. It sees a backslash. Aha! A special character is coming up! So R uses the backslash to escape the special character, and the special character is interpreted literally. But wait! The special character is supposed to be part of a regex pattern, and regex also uses backslashes to escape special characters. Whatever follows the backslash is going to be interpreted literally. When the string is passed to the regex engine, it sees a backslash followed by a special character. It does not see the backslash as part of the regex pattern, because R has already used it to escape the special character,\nSo now, to get the regex engine to see the backslash as part of the regex pattern, you need to escape the backslash itself in R. Hence, you use double backslashes (\\\\) in R strings to represent a single backslash in the regex pattern. The first backslash escapes the second backslash in R, and the regex engine sees a single backslash followed by the special character, allowing it to interpret the special character according to regex rules."

For example, you could set 2 deadlines for each planned submission (target and extended) or just add a note about how you will commit to meeting your goals given your accommodations (e.g., allowing for a default extension of X days on all deadlines). Ultimately, you’ll be the one reflecting on your progress and suggesting a grade. You are responsible for staying accountable to yourself to meet the broad learning objectives stated above, but you have control over what that will look like.\nIf you struggle with this kind of planning, whether or not you have SDS accommodations, I recommend starting with one of the example accountability plans. Personalize it to the extent you feel comfortable, or just leave it as-is if the idea of a self-paced course is overwhelming.\n\n\n\nInitial Plan\nDue: Monday, January 12th, 2026\nCreate an individual accountability plan to follow throughout the quarter. The way you structure your plan is up to you, but it should minimally lay out your targets, timeline, and priorities for the quarter. To get started, think about questions like:\n\nTargets: What is your target grade for the course? How many points do you plan to earn in each category (core standards, data project, enrichment, community engagement, accountability)? Will you aim for mostly 4s, 5s, or 6s on core standards? Will you plan on “buffer” points?\nTimeline: When do you plan to complete each core standard? When will you work on your data project? When will you decide whether to ? How will you space out your work to avoid last-minute stress?\nPriorities: Which standards or activities are most important to you? Are there any that you expect to be particularly challenging? How will you allocate your time and energy accordingly?\n\nI recommend also incorporating one or more less measurable elements:\n\nStrategies: What strategies will you use to stay on track? Will you set specific weekly goals? Use a planner or calendar? Seek support from peers or instructors?\nContingencies: How will you handle unexpected challenges or changes in your schedule? What will you do if you fall behind or need to adjust your plan?\nMotivation: Why is this course important to you? What are your personal or professional goals related to data analysis and R programming? How will you stay motivated throughout the quarter?\n\nThe only requirements are that you 1) define elements #1-3 in some way and 2) submit the initial reflection by Monday of Week 2. If you join the course in Week 2 or later, contact Dr. Dowling to set a modified deadline.\n\n\nMid-Quarter Reflection & Plan Update\nDue: Monday, February 2nd, 2026\nReflect on your progress toward your accountability plan and update it as needed. Submit a revised accountability plan that includes:\n\nA summary of your progress so far, including what you have completed and any challenges you faced.\nAn updated timeline for the rest of the quarter, including any changes to your targets or priorities.\nAny new strategies or contingencies you have developed based on your experiences so far.\n\n\n\nFinal Reflection & Plan Update\nDue: Monday, February 23rd, 2026\nReflect on your overall progress throughout the quarter and submit a final accountability plan that includes:\n\nA summary of your overall progress, including what you have completed and any challenges you faced.\nA clear list of what you need to do before the quarter ends to meet your goal, and a timeline for completing those tasks.\nA reflection on what you learned about accountability and time management during the course, including any strategies that worked well for you and areas for improvement in the future.\nA suggested grade (0-10 points) based on your performance in meeting the broad learning objectives related to accountability and time management.\n\nRemember that your grade for this is based on the two broad learning objectives about developing a research workflow and staying accountable to yourself. This is not about what specific learning objectives you met or how satisfied you are with the work you have delivered. It’s possible that you did amazing work but struggled with accountability, or that you failed to demonstrate technical skills but still developed strong habits for planning and follow-through.\nSimilarly, the grade you assign yourself should be based primarily on how you used the plan, not the quality of the initial plan. If you started the class with a poor understanding of how much time and effort would be required, but you adjusted your plan and successfully met your goals, that is much more valuable than designing an ideal plan at the start and never looking at it again.\nIn assigning yourself a grade, consider questions like:\n\nHow realistic was your initial plan? If/when you identified unrealistic plans, did you adjust them appropriately?\nHow well did you stick to your plan? Did you complete tasks on time? If you fell behind, did you take steps to get back on track?\nHow effectively did you manage your time? Did you allocate enough time for each task, or did you underestimate the time required?\nDid you meet or exceed the targets you set for yourself? Did you keep sight of your priorities?"

If I have extra time, great, but not essential for my goals.\n\n\nStrategies\n\nWeekly check-in: Every Sunday, review what I completed this week and what’s due next week, consider checking in with partner/group if I’m not doing great with following my own deadlines\nOffice hours: Attend at least 2 office hours sessions (one before mid-quarter, one before Week 8)\nSlack engagement: Post at least once per week in discussion channels to stay connected\nBuffer time: Plan to finish each core standard 2-3 days before I want to move on, in case troubleshooting takes longer than expected\nFocused core projects: Plan for a lot of small projects to target just 1-3 standards each. Combine into bigger projects if that feels realistic.\n\n\n\nContingencies\n\nIf I fall behind by Week 5, I’ll reassess whether I can realistically complete all 10 core standards or should focus on 8-9 strong submissions\nIf a core standard takes much longer than expected, I’ll start/join a study group\nIf I’m ahead of schedule by Week 7, I’ll consider adding one enrichment project or improving earlier core standards submissions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2: Front-Loaded with Flexibility\n\n\n\n\nTarget grade: A (aim for 100/100 points for buffer over the required 94)\n\nPoint breakdown:\n\nCore Standards: 60 points (aim for only 5s and 6s)\nIntegrative Data Project: 18 points\nAccountability: 10 points\nCommunity Engagement: 10 points\nEnrichment: 5 points (1-2 projects)\n\n\nTimeline\n\nWeeks 1-4 (heavy workload period)\nI have more time in January, so I’m front-loading work before other commitments pick up.\n\nCore standards:\n\nComplete 1 big(ish) combined core standards + enrichment project.\nPrimarily target skills 1-5.\nSince I already have some prior knowledge of basic tidyverse stuff, I can try to add in one or more of 6-8.\nI’m very familiar with the theory of basic data structures and control flow from my Python class last quarter, so I can aim for a couple 6s.\n\nEnrichment: While completing the core standards project, keep a debugging and AI use journal to include for enrichment points.\nCommunity: Start an accountability group with other students and ask if anyone wants to do a group project in the second half of the quarter.\nIntegrative Data Project:\n\nConfirm that my thesis project data is in good shape to use for the integrative data project, including checking with my PI that I’ve anonymized everything correctly\nCreate the repo & RStudio project, set up the manuscript qmd, add a source script for data import and basic cleaning\nAsk the postdoc I’m working with if she wants to be a collaborator on the repo\nSubmit a draft of by the end of Week 4 no matter how much/little progress I’ve made\n\n\n\n\nWeek 5 (mid-quarter check-in & in-class workshop)\n\nRecruit a few people for a group project (or pick something to complete by myself if I can’t find a group)\nIf needed: Complete 1 smaller core standards project targeting any skills I didn’t get 5s in\nReview all the “soft” stuff for the IDE, like making sure I’m set up with lots of comments, using informative commits, and adding in narrative text that I already have drafted from my thesis proposal\n\n\n\nWeeks 6-8 (managing other deadlines)\nI have major deadlines in another class, so keeping D2M-R work lighter but consistent.\n\nCore standards:\n\nComplete 1 combined core standards + enrichment project.\n\nTry to make this a group project to show community engagement later\n\nPrimarily target skills 6-12. I may have to work ahead a little bit to add simple analysis/visualization before we cover it in class in week 8. There’s at least one very structured project that looks like I can do it mostly in advance and then finish in week 8 if needed.\n\nEnrichment: I should have earned ~5 enrichment points with the first project, but if I need more I can submit a small, dedicated project here. I think I’m going to need a dedicated package to import some of my data that’s in a specialized format, so I could show that as independent learning and documentation.\nCommunity:\n\nKeep posting to slack. Make an office hours appointment if I’m feeling behind.\n\nIntegrative Data Project:\n\nSubmit a second draft by start of week 8 with whatever additions and revisions I can make.\nIf I feel comfortable with adding basic data reporting early, I can try for this to be the final draft. Otherwise I’ll just plan to have minor additions after this one.\n\n\n\n\nWeek 9 (buffer week & in-class workshop)\n\nFinish data project if the 2nd draft wasn’t complete (start now, submit finals week)\nMay need to do 1 more core standard project to make up for 4s\n\n\n\n\nPriorities\nMost important: Demonstrating strong technical skills on core standards, including a few 6s early on given my prior knowledge of basic Python.\nAlso important: Starting my data project early so I’m not rushing at the end, and actually making progress on the thesis instead of just focusing on class minimum requirements.\nNice to have: 1-2 enrichment projects that showcase problem-solving or collaboration skills. I’d prefer to have these combined with the core projects, but I think I can put a couple small projects together relatively quickly if I need to.\nBonus goal: I’d like to contribute to one of the course repos. It feels to intimidating to make it part of the plan, but if I get more comfortable I want to try.\n\n\nStrategies\n\nFront-load early weeks: Take advantage of lighter workload in January to get ahead\nEnrichment integration: Where possible, add enrichment-y stuff to the IDE drafts and core projects to get some buffer points without dedicated enrichment projects\nLearning ahead: Get a head start of tidyverse stuff. Try to start data reporting in week 7 and then fill in gaps when we cover it in class in week 8.\nPeer collaboration: Form a study group or accountability buddy system with 2-3 classmates early, so I can entice them into doing a group project with me in week 5 or 6.\n\n\n\nContingencies\n\nIf I can’t cover as many skills in the big project in Weeks 1-4, I’ll adjust to doing a few smaller projects in the second half instead of another big one.\nIf enrichment projects feel too time-consuming, I’ll drop them.\nCommunity engagement and accountability should be easy perfect scores as long as I pay attention, but I’ll need to check in often to make sure I am in fact paying attention.\nIf I’m struggling with a concept, I’ll attend office hours immediately rather than letting confusion build up."

    "text": "Suggestions\n\nBe realistic. It’s better to set achievable goals and exceed them than to set overly ambitious goals and fall short. Consider your other commitments and responsibilities when creating your plan.\nPlan for skill snowballing. The skills taught in this class are cumulative, which means that early in the quarter your projects will be simpler, taking relatively little time to tackle but only demonstrating one or two core standards at a time. As the quarter progresses, projects demonstrating more advanced standards will necessarily also demonstrate earlier standards, meaning more time and effort per project, but also ample opportunity to fill in gaps and improve scores on earlier standards. Critically, you will inevitably spend much more time on core standards assignments in the second half of the quarter than the first. If you want to distribute your workload more evenly, consider front-loading enrichment activities, starting your data project early, and/or working ahead with the many resources available to get a head start on a more advanced project. Many projects on the menu require skills covered over several weeks, but you can make progress on them as we go rather than waiting until we’ve covered all the material necessary for 100% of the project.\nWork with others. Share your plan with classmates, form study groups, and check-in on Slack when you’re nervous about falling behind. Accountability to yourself is an important skill to build, but building in accountability to others never hurts."

Points are earned as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoints\nComponent\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n12\nCore standards\nDemonstrate all 12 core standards at least at the 4-point level within your project. Each standard demonstrated earns 1 point.\n\n\n2\nReproducibility\nYour code is fully reproducible, with no errors when run from start to finish in a clean R environment.\n\n\n2\nDocumentation\nYour code is clearly commented, and your Quarto document includes narrative text that explains your coding choices and data presentation.\n\n\n2\nCohesion\nYour data wrangling, statistics, and plots are clearly connected with narrative text and tell a coherent story about the data.\n\n\n2\nPresentation\nYour Quarto document is well-formatted, so that the .qmd is each to work with and the knitted .pdf is professional and readable.\n\n\n\n“Above and beyond” demonstrations of core standards or exceptional quality may receive bonus points at the grader’s discretion, but the project cannot contribute more than 20 points to the final grade. In other words, outstanding use of one standard might earn you a point that compensates for weaker presentation or documentation, but not a point of extra credit.\n\nSubmission\nYou may submit the data project up to 3 times throughout the quarter. With each draft, you will also include a self-assessment, indicating which standards you believe you have demonstrated and how well you have met each of the grading components above. After scoring your work, your grader will provide feedback as a response to your self-assessment to help you improve your project for future submissions.\nYou are allowed – and encouraged! – to submit partial drafts of your project to confirm that you are on the right track before submitting a full draft. You aren’t expected to be able to demonstrate a skill before we cover it in class, so early submissions may only demonstrate a subset of the standards. That’s fine! Submitting a draft that shows only a few objectives will let you confirm that you are in fact meeting expectations for those objectives and will give you guidance on where to go next.\nGrades for resubmissions will replace previous scores. Your grade for the data project will be the score earned on your last submission before the end-of-quarter deadline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningData Project vs. Core Standards Assignments\n\n\n\nThe Integrative Research Project is graded entirely as its own 20‑point assignment. Although you are required to demonstrate the 12 core learning objectives, your Core Standards Mastery score (out of 60) is calculated only from the standards-focused assignments and is not affected by your project score or project work.\nUnless an assignment says otherwise or you receive advance permission from the professor, there should be no overlap in data or code between your core standards assignments and your integrative data project."

Hopefully you have a plan for what data you’ll be using, which should be enough to form a sensible name. Though it’s generally not recommended if you can avoid it, you can change the name later (via GitHub settings) if needed, so there’s really no reason to wait on this.\nStart by adding the essential files:\n\nREADME.md and .gitignore can be created when you make the repo on GitHub or added later via RStudio\nCreate a manuscript Quarto file (e.g., manuscript.qmd) in the root directory.\nAdd a /data folder with any data files you have ready to go – be sure they are anonymized and safe to upload to a private repo first!\n\nAdd some content (real or placeholder) to your readme and manuscript files so you have something to commit and push. Experiment with simple markdown formatting in both files (e.g., headings, bold/italic text, lists, links, etc.) and add a code chunk to the manuscript file.\nRemember the cardinal rules of Git: Pull when you sit down. Commit more than you think you should. Push when you stand up.\n\nExplore the Skeleton Repo core skills project. You can complete this right now to get points for objectives 1 & 2, or start it now and build it up over the next couple weeks to add points toward objectives 3-5 (or more).\n\nSkeleton Repo core skills project instructions\nNote that this project requires creating a private repo from scratch in the D2M-R organization.

After this week, you’re ready to start any of them, but most have have some tasks related to factor variables, which we’ll cover week 7.\n\nclean-level-1-mtcars: Structured exercise to introduce data manipulation in the tidyverse. Primarily uses dplyr and tidyr, but includes some manipulation of strings and factors as well\nclean-level-2-midwest: Open-ended with a general goal but no step-by-step instructions. Similar content to level 1.\nclean-group: Group project where each member makes a clean dataset messy, then cleans another member’s messy dataset following tidy data principles.\nwrangle-level-1-starwars: Structured exercise to go further into data wrangling. Includes a mix of dplyr, tidyr, stringr, and forcats.\nwrangle-level-2-gapminder: Open-ended with a general goal but no step-by-step instructions. Similar content to level 1.\nwrangle-group: (Similar to the group cleaning) Group project where each member un-wrangles a dataset, then wrangles another member’s dataset to as close to the original as possible.\nrecreate-function: A more advanced, freeform project where you pick a function from an R package and try to recreate it using tidyverse tools. Complex, and good for showing R programming & tidyverse objectives at a high level at the same time.\n\nWhere is your data project? We’re more than half-way through the quarter.\n\nBy this point you should minimally have a dedicated GitHub repository for your data project that syncs with an RStudio project. It should include the standard git repo files and structure (like your README and gitignore), data in the form of a .csv or other tablar file, and a Quarto notebook with a basic outline of the project.\nIdeally you also have one or more R scripts that do things like define functions and perform initial data read-in, wrangling, and write-out.\nIf you haven’t started yet, this needs to be a top priority.\nIf you have started, consider submitting whatever you have for feedback. Remember you absolutely do not have to have a complete project to submit (I strongly recommend you do not wait nearly that long!). Indicate what objectives you’re attempting and get clear feedback on whether you’re meeting expectations (and if not, how to do so). Even if you’re only attempting to demonstrate a few objectives, there’s no harm in getting guidance on what you have so far.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHousekeeping\n\n\n\n\n\nGitHub Submission: This is now a screen recording of the github submission process you can view here extremely detailed written instructions.\nHunter’s Plain-English Guide to R: Hunter has turned his notes into a Quarto document and allowed me to share it on the website. It’s a great resource for beginners and a nice complement to the textbook and lecture materials. You can find it here.\nExample data project: As I mentioned last week, I’m setting up an example data project that shows how to meet the basic requirements for the integrated data project. I have initialized that repo in the d2m-r github org, and you can view it here.\n\nNote: As of Feb 8 2026, this repo is not complete. It does not currently meet the requirements for the integrative data project! I’ll be updating it as I have time, but I wanted to share it in its current state in case it’s helpful to anyone as a starting point. I’ll make an announcement when it’s complete."

    "text": "citr\nThe citr package is an RStudio addin that allows you to search for and add citations into your text rather than manually entering the key. You’ll be very grateful to have this addin when your bibliography grows to dozens or hundreds of references.3\nThere are two main approaches to using citr with Zotero and Quarto:\n\nLink citr to your Zotero library. This allows you to search your full Zotero library for references. You search for one or more references, select them, and insert them into your document. If the reference is not in your bibliography, citr will automatically add it to the .bib file - so handy! Usually if someone talks about using citr with Zotero, they mean this method.\n\nTo link citr to Zotero, go to the Addins dropdown menu in RStudio and select “citr: Insert Citations”.\nIf you have Zotero open and Better BibTeX installed, you should see an option to link to Zotero. Click this and follow the instructions. It may take a minute to index your library.\nOnce linked, searching in the citr addin should show you results from anywhere in your Zotero library. \n\nLink citr to a bib file. Rather than search your whole library, this method allows you to search only the references already in your bibtex bibliography file for that notebook. Since it only accesses the citations already in the bibliography, it can’t add new references to the bibliography for you.\n\nTo link citr to a .bib file, add the bibliography: bibliography.bib line to the YAML header of your Quarto notebook (which you should have already done in setup).\nOnce linked, searching in the citr addin should show you results from the .bib file you linked to. \n\n\nOption 1 is more powerful and can be more convenient, but Option 2 has its advantages (and has recently become my preferred method). For one thing, if you have a massive Zotero library, linking to the whole library can be slow and unwieldy. For another, if you’re working on a paper with a specific set of references, you may not want to see all the other references in your library where you could accidentally select a reference with a similar title. It’s also better suited to collaboration, where you and your coauthors can add citions whether or not both libraries have the same references.\nThe reason I’ve recently switched to Option 2 is that I’ve found the automatic updating of the .bib file from Zotero to be much more reliable in Zotero 7.0 (though I admit I’m still kind of paranoid and check it manually). This method means I do 100% of my editing and organizing in one place: the Zotero folder. I can add and remove citations and edit metadata, then see that reflected in my Quarto render. The fact that I cannot automatically add citations from elsewhere in my library is useful, because it forces me to be more intentional about what references I include in a given paper and ensures I can actually go find all the actual literature (not just the citations) in one place when I need it."

I recommend containing those projects (i.e., repositories) in one directory, then creating a “catch-all” fake repo folder to set as a default, e.g., “~/repos/other”.\n\nPane Layout\n\nRStudio looks like a grid of 4 panels which you can rearrange as you like.

    "text": "Source/Code Editing (the “Data” bit)\n\nCode\n\nEditing\n\n“Insert spaces for Tab” - Whether to use tabs or spaces in programming is an absurd and timeless debate. R is a whitespace-insensitive programming language, meaning any kind of blank characters (both spaces and tabs) are helpful for readability but don’t matter for running the code. Use spaces, use tabs, use nothing (well, use something — human people need to read your code!). It may just be a matter of form rather than function, but you’ll likely develop a preference here. Personally I check the box and use a tab width of 4.\nThe rest of these options are things you might want to tweak if something feels unintuitive while you’re coding. For example, when you insert a full line comment, what should happen when you hit enter and start a new line? Should we assume that next line will be a continuation of that long comment? Which is more intuitive for you?\nCheck out the keybindings (click “Modify Keyboard Shortcuts” to see them all) to get an overview of the default keyboard shortcuts. Set this to another set of shortcuts (like Sublime Text or vi) if you’re already used to something else and/or customize shortcuts to your liking. Most of these shortcuts you’ll never use, but others you’ll rely on heavily (e.g., inserting pipes and new code chunks).\n“Ctrl+Enter executes:” This is really just specifying the behavior of one important shortcut. When you use this keybind (for Mac users, both ctrl and cmd work here), it will run code where your cursor is. It’s up to you how much of that code should run — typically either that exact line of code (until a line break) or the current R statement (ignoring line breaks, but stopping at the end of the statement or pipe chain). Mostly I just point this out so you know the shortcut exists! You don’t need to highlight the code and click the run button every time.\n\nCompletion\n\nThis section has options for autocompleting functions. So if you type “read_” you’ll see a popup list of all the functions (from loaded packages) that begin with “read_”. By default you can use the arrow keys to scroll through the options and tab to complete the one you have selected. You can adjust this behavior or disable it entirely.\n\n\nAppearance\n\nSetting up how you want RStudio to look can be just as much about function as about aesthetics. If you’re perfectly happy with RStudio’s look out of the box, great! If something feels unintuitive, if you find the source code difficult to read, if the layout leaves you mixing up the source and console panels, etc., mess around with this stuff for a better overall experience. Mess with the theme for the RStudio GUI and text/font if you want.\nSelect your favorite editor theme or create your own! This is like setting light or dark mode, but x1000. The default is perfectly fine, but you’ll be amazed at how much a few subtle changes can make for your ability to stare at code for hours on end without getting a migraine.\n\nIf you’re watching me demo something and wondering what my theme is — it’s a modified version of Clouds."

This is different from if you were working in a regular R document or the console, where (depending on the type) output would show up in the console or a plot/viewer tab. Not all packages play equally nicely with R Notebooks. If something isn’t rendering output as expected, troubleshoot by running the code somewhere else.\n\nVisual\n\nDO NOT USE THE VISUAL EDITOR.\n\nFor one thing, it’s still pretty glitchy. Also, when it works as intended it still produces some odd results. Switching between visual and markdown editing will significantly change your text. The visual editor is more built for HTML than Markdown, so if you go back to the plain text editor much of your Markdown will be HTML-ified with no simple way to get it back.\nBut also, part of this class is learning to work in R Markdown. So that’s just what we’re doing.\n\n\nCitations\n\nIf you were to use the visual editor — which you are not — you could set it up for citation features.

Even in D2M-R I when we don’t cover advanced analysis, this should still be the goal for your data. This means having sufficient observations, relevant variables for your research questions, and enough complexity to demonstrate meaningful data wrangling skills without being so messy that cleaning becomes the entire project.\n\n\n“Your own data” means data you have a personal stake in analyzing as part of research you’re conducting or contributing to.

Students working with thesis data (BA or MA), lab projects, or ongoing research get the most from this course. You’ll build directly applicable skills and advance your actual research.\nQuarter 2: You are required to use your own data for the integrative project. You must have a dataset with personal investment and clear research questions before the start of the quarter.\nIf you lack your own data, publicly available datasets work for Quarter 1. However, start identifying your own dataset early—you’ll need it by Quarter 2.\n\n\n\nStart with your research question. Identify the domain (psychology, public health, social science) and core variables you need. This focus prevents getting lost in vast repositories.\nUse multiple search approaches:\n\nDomain-specific repositories (ICPSR, Roper, Journal of Open Psychology Data) offer curated, documented datasets\nMeta-search engines (Google Dataset Search, re3data.org) cast a wider net across repositories\nGeneral platforms (Harvard Dataverse, Figshare, Kaggle) provide diverse options with varying quality\nSpecialized collections (Data is Plural, Components, Awesome Public Datasets) surface interesting datasets you might not find otherwise\n\nEvaluate documentation quality. Well-documented datasets include codebooks, data dictionaries, and methodology descriptions. Poor documentation will cost you time and introduce errors.\nSee below for a list of public data collections to get started.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou need a dataset covering all variables for your analysis. If your research question requires demographics, behavioral measures, and temporal data, the dataset must include all three.\nPartial datasets work only if you can extract a complete subset. Pilot data with full variable coverage beats a larger dataset missing key variables.\n\n\n\nCheck for uniform column names, consistent date formats, and standardized categorical values. Inconsistencies like “Yes”/“yes”/“Y” or “01/15/2024”/“2024-01-15” create silent errors that corrupt analyses.\nInspect the first 50-100 rows for structural oddities before committing to a dataset. Structural inconsistency at the outset doesn’t need to be a dealbreaker, but it means you’ll have more work to do in data preparation stages.\n\n\n\nR processes plain text. While packages can read Excel or SPSS files, you’ll convert them to CSV or TSV eventually. Start with formats ending in .csv, .tsv, or .txt when possible.\nMost repositories offer CSV export. If only proprietary formats exist, verify conversion tools work before investing time in the dataset.\n\n\n\nData must organize into rows and columns. Standard tidy format (each column = variable, each row = observation) simplifies analysis, but transposed or nested structures work if convertible.\nSpreadsheets typically meet this criterion. Unstructured text or XML requires preprocessing.\n\n\n\nThe dataset must enable answering specific research questions. On day one, articulate 2-3 concrete questions the data can address.\nStudents with interesting research projects tend to be more interested in the work and generally learn more. Generic exploration of unfocused datasets produces generic insights.\n\n\n\nGitHub retains complete history. Only commit fully anonymized data. Never plan to “anonymize later.”\nFor human subjects data, verify no personally identifiable information exists. Random participant IDs, geographic aggregation to region level, and date jittering are standard approaches.\nIf you are using publicly available data from a credible source, you don’t have to worry about anonymization. However, if you are using your own data or “quasi-”open data (like from a large research project with collaborators at multiple institutions), you’ll need to be very careful about this.\nCheck with advisors about discipline-specific anonymization standards.\n\n\n\n\nDataset too large. Start with manageable size (under 100MB). You can always expand later.\nMissing codebook. Variable names like “V1”, “V2”, “Q37” without explanation make analysis impossible.\nAggregated data when you need individual observations. Summary statistics can’t be disaggregated.\nLicensing restrictions. Verify the dataset permits academic use and redistribution if needed.\nFormat mismatch. PDF tables or image-based data require extraction work that exceeds course scope.\n\n\n\nIf uncertain about dataset suitability, download it, examine the first few rows, and bring specific questions to Dr. Dowling or your TA. “Can this work?” questions need concrete examples, not abstract descriptions."

If your research question requires demographics, behavioral measures, and temporal data, the dataset must include all three.\nPartial datasets work only if you can extract a complete subset. Pilot data with full variable coverage beats a larger dataset missing key variables.\n\n\n\nCheck for uniform column names, consistent date formats, and standardized categorical values. Inconsistencies like “Yes”/“yes”/“Y” or “01/15/2024”/“2024-01-15” create silent errors that corrupt analyses.\nInspect the first 50-100 rows for structural oddities before committing to a dataset. Structural inconsistency at the outset doesn’t need to be a dealbreaker, but it means you’ll have more work to do in data preparation stages.\n\n\n\nR processes plain text. While packages can read Excel or SPSS files, you’ll convert them to CSV or TSV eventually. Start with formats ending in .csv, .tsv, or .txt when possible.\nMost repositories offer CSV export. If only proprietary formats exist, verify conversion tools work before investing time in the dataset.\n\n\n\nData must organize into rows and columns. Standard tidy format (each column = variable, each row = observation) simplifies analysis, but transposed or nested structures work if convertible.\nSpreadsheets typically meet this criterion. Unstructured text or XML requires preprocessing.\n\n\n\nThe dataset must enable answering specific research questions. On day one, articulate 2-3 concrete questions the data can address.\nStudents with interesting research projects tend to be more interested in the work and generally learn more. Generic exploration of unfocused datasets produces generic insights.\n\n\n\nGitHub retains complete history. Only commit fully anonymized data. Never plan to “anonymize later.”\nFor human subjects data, verify no personally identifiable information exists. Random participant IDs, geographic aggregation to region level, and date jittering are standard approaches.\nIf you are using publicly available data from a credible source, you don’t have to worry about anonymization. However, if you are using your own data or “quasi-”open data (like from a large research project with collaborators at multiple institutions), you’ll need to be very careful about this.\nCheck with advisors about discipline-specific anonymization standards."

Open the Git pane in RStudio to see that this file is listed as an untracked file. Git has detected a difference between the contents of the last commit and the work you have done in your project directory, namely adding this new file.\nThis HTML file is generated automatically by GitHub when it renders your README.md file, so it doesn’t need to be synced with GitHub or tracked by Git.\nOpen the .gitignore file in RStudio. This file tells git which files and folders to ignore when detecting and committing changes.\nIf you initialized your repo using the R gitignore template, it should already include common files and folders to ignore for R projects, like:\n# History files\n.Rhistory\n.Rapp.history\n\n# Session Data files\n.RData\n.RDataTmp\n\n# User-specific files\n.Ruserdata\nAdd the following lines to the .gitignore file to ignore the generated HTML file:\n# Autogenerated files\nREADME.html\nSave the .gitignore file. Take another look at your Git pane. The README.html file should no longer be listed as an untracked file, and you should see a new file appear in the list of detected differences: .gitignore.\nYou should also see the .Rproj file itself in the Git pane. This is a file that RStudio automatically creates for every project with settings specific to your RStudio environment. I prefer not to track or sync this file, since it can contain user-specific settings that may not be relevant to other users of the repo.\nThe R gitignore template does not include this file by default, but does already have a section for RStudio files. Add your .Rproj file to that section by adding *.Rproj to your .gitignore file:\n# RStudio files\n.Rproj.user/\n*.Rproj\nBy including the * wildcard character, Git will ignore all files with the .Rproj extension. This is more relevant for other file types, but is nice here as a favor to anyone cloning your project. They may give their R project a different name, which would change the .Rproj filename. Listing out the specific filename would not ignore their file, but using the wildcard will.\nSave the .gitignore file again, and notice that the .Rproj file has disappeared from the Git pane.\n\n\nCommit your changes and push to GitHub\nIn the Git pane, check the box next to .gitignore to stage the change. “Stage” means to prepare the change to be committed. Only staged files will be included in the next commit.\nIn this case, we have only made changes to one file, so we are staging that one file. If you have made changes to multiple files, you can choose to only stage some of them. This is useful if some of the changes you made are not ready to be committed, or if your changes are unrelated and you want to commit them separately with different explanations in the commit messages.\nClick the “Commit” button to open the Review Changes dialog. Selecting the gitignore file allows you to see all the changes you made to it since the last commit.\nMake sure that the box next to .gitignore is checked in the dialog, indicating that it is staged for commit. If you forget to stage/unstage files in the Git pane, you can still do so here.\nAdd a brief, informative commit message:\nadd .Rproj and README.html to .gitignore\n\n\n\nCommit dialog\n\n\nClick the “Commit” button in the dialog to finalize the commit. You’ll see a new dialog summarizing what was included.\n\n\n\nCommit summary dialog\n\n\nClick “Close” to return to the Review Changes dialog, which should no longer list any staged or unstaged changed files. Instead, you should see the message: “Your branch is ahead of ‘origin/main’ by 1 commit.” This means that you have made a commit in your local repo that has not yet been pushed to the remote repo on GitHub. You can confirm this by refreshing your repo’s GitHub page, which will be unchanged.\nTo actually sync your changes to GitHub, click the “Push” button in the Git pane. You’ll see another dialog confirming that the push was successful. This dialog will also show any warnings or errors if the push failed.\nBack in the Review Changes window, the message about your branch being ahead of ‘origin/main’ should be gone, indicating that your local and remote repos are now in sync.\nConfirm this by refreshing your repo’s GitHub page. You should see a few changes:\n\nThe commit you just made is listed above the file list\nThe commit message is also displayed next to the .gitignore file, but not the README file, since you did not make any changes to that file in RStudio.\n\n\n\n\nGitHub after push"

Add a sentence under this heading indicating that you made this change in RStudio:\n## Conflicting Changes\n\nThis change was made in RStudio.\nSave, stage, and commit this change with the message example change with RStudio, but do not push yet.\n\n\nMake and commit a conflicting change on GitHub\nOn GitHub, open README.md in the browser, and under the same heading, add instead:\n## Conflicting Changes\n\nThis change was made on GitHub.\nCommit directly to the main branch with the message example change on GitHub.\n\n\nTry to Push & Pull from RStudio\nBack in RStudio, click Push in the Git pane. Instead of a summary of the push, you’ll see an error message that the push was rejected.\n\n\n\nPush rejected error\n\n\nThe dialog suggests that your changes can’t be pushed because the remote repository has conflicting changes that must be pulled first.\nPer this suggestion, click the “Pull” icon in the Git pane or Review Changes window to pull the changes from GitHub. Git will attempt to merge, but will report a merge conflict due to “divergent branches” that must be reconciled.\n In the Git pane (not the Review Changes window), notice that there is a dropdown arrow next to the Pull icon. Click this arrow and “Pull with Rebase.”\nThis will attempt to reapply your local commit on top of the pulled commit from GitHub. Sometimes this will be enough to resolve the conflict automatically, but in this case, it will still report a merge conflict that you need to resolve manually. The dialog gives you some hints on how to resolve the conflict, but they may not make a lot of sense to you right now.\n\n\n\nMerge conflict with rebase error\n\n\nClose the dialog and return to the Git pane. You’ll see that:\n\nYou’re not in the “main” branch anymore, but in a special “rebasing main” state.\nThe push and pull buttons are disabled.\nThe README.md file is listed as having a conflict that needs to be resolved. The orange “U” indicates that the file is “unmerged.”\n\n\n\nIdentify the Conflict\nIf you already have the README file open, you’ll see text from both versions of the file, along with special marker lines indicating the conflict.\nOpen RStudio’s Terminal pane (not the console!) and type:\ngit status\nThis will:\n\nShow you the ongoing status of your repo: interactive rebase in progress; onto 02bb8e3\nGive you some hints on how to complete or abandon the rebase (using terminal commands)\nIndicate which files are unmerged and need to be resolved: both modified: README.md\n\nOpen README.md in RStudio if it isn’t open already. You’ll see the conflict marked with lines like:\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD\nThis change was made in RStudio.\n=======\nThis change was made on GitHub.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; [commit-hash]\nThese markers show both versions of the change and indicate a conflict to be resolved manually.\nThanks to the clear example changes, it’s easy to see that the text above the === line is the local commit made in RStudio, and the text below it is the remote commit made on GitHub. This is always the case: local changes are above the === line, and remote changes are below it.\n\n\nResolve the Conflict in RStudio\nEdit the file to remove the marker lines (&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;, =======, &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;) and decide which content to keep, or combine both as appropriate. In this case, you can combine both changes:\n## Conflicting Changes\n\nThese changes were made in RStudio and on GitHub.\nSave the file, go to the Git pane, stage the file, then commit. This is the same process as before, but notice the “no branch, rebasing main” message at the top of the pane. That tells you that even though you’re following the same general steps, Git is in a special state of merging files and handling things a bit differently.\nUse a commit message that indicates that you are resolving a merge conflict, e.g., resolve merge conflict in README.md. (We’ll come back to what the best commit message here would be in the last step!)\n\n\nComplete the Rebase\nEverything should now look normal again in the Git pane, except that you’re still in the “rebasing main” state. To complete the rebase and return to the main branch, go back to the Terminal pane and type:\ngit rebase --continue\nSince we’ve already staged and committed the resolved file, this command will complete the rebase and return you to the main branch. If there were any other conflicts, it would prompt you to resolve them before continuing.\nBack in the Git pane, you should now see that you’re back on the main branch, and the push and pull buttons are enabled again. You’ll see the message that your branch is ahead of ‘origin/main’ by 1 commit, indicating that you have local changes that need to be pushed to GitHub. Complete the merge by clicking the Push button to sync your resolved changes to GitHub.\nTake another look the the GitHub page for your repo. If all has gone well, you should see your latest commit message indicating that you resolved the merge conflict, and the README.md file should show the combined changes.\n\n\nReview your commit history\nEverything is good to go, but take a look through your commit history one last time.\nOn GitHub, click the “X commits” link above the file list to view the commit history. In RStudio, click the “History” button in the Git pane.\nIn both places, you should see 5 commits in order of newest to oldest:\n\nThe merge conflict resolution commit\nThe readme change (with conflict) you made on GitHub\nThe formatting change (no conflict) you made on GitHub\nThe gitignore additions (no conflict) you made in RStudio\nThe initial commit made when you created the repo\n\nNotice what is missing: the commit you made in RStudio that caused the conflict.\nThis commit is not in the history because it was effectively rewritten during the rebase process. Your commit message “example change with RStudio” is gone, and replaced by “resolve merge conflict in README.md”.\nThis may or may not be what you want in practice, so be thoughtful about the commit you use to resolve the conflict. Imagine a scenario where the GitHub change was a minor typo fix, but your RStudio change was a substantial addition to your data analysis scripts. In that case, a message about merge conflict would not be a good representation of the important work you did in RStudio. It would be more informative to use a commit message that reflects the substantive change you made, and just note in the extended description that you resolved a merge conflict."

It should put you in the best place for effective troubleshooting, for reproducing analyses, and for returning to your code months or years from now.

If you break a rule (like you try to start a variable name with a number) you get an error, which is a lot nicer than if it were to just run anyway and produce mysterious, inexplicable results.\nThis has a lot of advantages, but one downside is that your code can get extremely messy before things actually start to break. You can write perfectly functional R code that is utterly indecipherable to humans, including you-the-coder. Standardizing styling decisions helps keep things organized and human-friendly.\n\nStyle guides\nCoding style guides serve the same functions as publication style guides, like AP Style or the New York Times manual of style. They demand (or at least encourage) consistency, which should make things more comprehensible for you and your “readers” (collaborators).\nAn effective and comprehensive style guide for R programming will establish conventions for naming objects and functions, handling whitespace and punctuation, and preferred syntax or representations (e.g., a rule to use the &lt;- assignment operator rather than =). It will also likely contain guidelines for otherwise highly subjective things like how to structure comments, how verbose function definitions should be, how to clearly construct error messages, and the necessary elements and formatting of documentation.\nThe tidyverse style guide is an excellent, comprehensive, and widely used style guide for R. If you don’t already have a preferred style guide, I suggest starting here.\n\n\nInternal consistency\nThe best style guide is the one you can stick to. So long as (1) it functions within your environment (no matter how much you’d like to begin your variable names with numerals, it’s not a style option) and (2) it’s comprehensible (for you totally and to others generally), the internal consistency is what really matters.\nPay attention to how you manage to adhere to your style as you code. Are there guidelines you can’t seem to remember or always mess up? Are there things that just confuse you? Do you look back on your code that perfectly follows your style and forget why you styled certain things the way you did? These are most likely to be the breaking points for internal consistency. If some aspect of style isn’t helping your code be more comprehensible and more efficient to review and maintain, it’s counterproductive and you should change to something that will be more helpful.\nFor example, the tidyverse style guide recommends using underscores when naming all objects. I find that using underscores for everything leads me to mix up different kinds of objects. Is child_gesture the name of the dataframe with gesture-level coding or the column in that dataframe that contains frequency of children’s gestures? Is shrug_bar_plot the modified dataframe that is piped into a ggplot object, the ggplot object itself, the chunk name where the plot is defined, the chunk where it’s rendered, or something else?\nIt would be great if I was good enough at giving objects informative names (see below!) to not confuse myself with this style, but realistically it doesn’t work for me. Instead of using underscore separators for everything, I opt to use periods for “complex” objects dataframes, underscores for “simple” or “internal” objects like variables, camel-case for “publishable” objects like plots, and hyphens for “containers” like chunk and file names. Some people would find my system infuriating for any number of reasons, but over time I’ve found it works for me. Since I can be consistent with it, it really speeds up coding and debugging, and it doesn’t actively impede comprehensibility for others. That’s ultimately what matters.\nYou can view the custom style guide I (usually) follow here. Remember this is just what I have found works well for me. It’s not “correct” and you don’t have to use it!\n\nStyling tools\nThere are (at least) two well-maintained packages that can help you enforce style guides: lintr and styler. Both use tidyverse style by default, but are customizable to your preferred style rules.\n\n\nFinal notes on styling\nWhile standarizing your coding style is an essential “best practice,” remember that in the end styling is usually not make-or-break for your code. I do encourage you to aim for an internally consistent style, but don’t get lost in the weeds. Again: The best code is the code that works. You have limited time and energy to work on your project. Before you get too deep into developing your own personalized style or rigorously checking every detail of every script you’ve ever written to retroactively enforce a style, think about whether that’s truly the most productive use of your precious time. Hopefully at some point style really can be high priority, but if that’s not where you’re at right now, that’s fine!\n\n\n\nC Programming Style Guide Cartoon – “I hate programmers.”\n\n\n\n\nAnd one final recommendation: choose where to be cautious. It’s easy to avoid special characters even if they’re technically permissible sometimes, so just avoid them. Being concise is nice, but it’s probably safer to prioritize readability over conciseness. Keep your future self in mind. What can you do now to best help future-you when you come back to this project in a year having completely forgotten everything you’re doing now?"

    "text": "Intelligible\n\nInformative comments\nComments are an essential but easily overlooked part of your code. If you’re a beginner coder, commenting may feel burdensome, compounded by the fact that beginner coders should practice over-commenting to an extent (and chill out a bit as they gain experience). Fight the impulse to treat commenting as busy work or an unpleasant obligation. Comments are a critical tool for making something designed to be comprehensible to a machine equally comprehensible to the humans who actually have to do the work of designing and maintaining it.\n\n\n\nStop sign comments meme\n\n\n\n\nBorrowing from this stackoverflow blog post, here are 9 rules for effective commenting:\n\nComments should not duplicate the code.\nGood comments do not excuse unclear code.\nIf you can’t write a clear comment, there may be a problem with the code.\nExplain unidiomatic code in comments.\nProvide links to the original source of copied code.\nInclude links to external references where they will be most helpful.\nAdd comments when fixing bugs.\nUse comments to mark incomplete implementations.\n\nCheck out the original post for more information on what each of these rules means. The biggest picture take-aways should be that 1) comments are not optional and 2) the code tells you how, the comments tell you why.\n\nCommit messages\nAs you get used using github, think about your commit messages as the cousin of in-text comments. Your commit messages should be informative, clear, and concise. Your repo is a living thing (that’s the point!) and by the time you’re ready to never look at this thing ever again you’ll have committed a million changes. Your commit messages should tell that version of you exactly what the purpose of each commit was.\nImagine you are starting a project 3 years from now. Future-you knows that present-you wrote exactly the code you need at the beginning of present-you’s project, but by the end of this project that code was irrelevant and so (rightfully) removed from the “final” version. Future-you looks through the messages, find “Deleted chunk that calculates ratio of giant ducks to tiny dinosaurs in a fair fight,” and is indescribably grateful to present-you for writing clear commit messages.\n\n\nFinal note on comments\nPersonally, I don’t mind humorous comments or commit messages. I actively endorse them as a way to let things go, keep your priorities straight, vent frustration, seek some solidarity, and give future-you a chuckle. That said, not everyone appreciates overly casual commenting, which is certainly valid. Be mindful of keeping your comments professional if (and only if) necessary. (Please feel free to let your geek humor flag fly in D2M. I always appreciate a good “I have no idea why this works but for the love of god don’t change it.”)\n  \n\n\n\nMeaningful naming\nFor some reason every example in every programming tutorial ever will teach you how to create a variable with the name my_variable and a function with the name my_function. I get it, but these are objectively horrible names. Imagine looking through someone’s code and seeing my_function(my_variable, 2). What?? That better come with like 12 lines of comments because otherwise it’s total nonsense.\nOf course, no one actually recommends using my_whatever in your actual code, but it’s the principle of the thing! Designing object, function, and file names that actually tell you any useful information can be a lot harder than it sounds, but it’s a game-changer to the intelligibility of your code.\n\n“There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.”\n— Phil Karlton\n\nThe big rule here (vs a guideline): Names should describe the named thing.\n\n\n\n“Keep it simple, stupid – commitstrip.com\n\n\n\n\nA few guidelines for crafting meaningful names (source):\n\nAvoid disinformation. Don’t include _df in the name of a data.table, don’t name a function get_number if it returns a string.\nUse pronounceable names. Whether you want to or not you’ll inevitably talk about your code out loud (even if just to a rubber duck). It’s a lot easier to ask someone to check for errors in your child_gesture table or your group_SES_quartile function than cgtbl or grpsq. This doesn’t mean you can’t abbreviate: chi_gest and SES4 are perfectly pronounceable too (though less transparent, which is a trade-off you’ll need to consider).\nUse searchable names. x is a useful variable in math, not in programming. Plan ahead for when you need to cmd+f to replace all cases of a name with a slightly different version. Examples will often use p to name plots, but replacing all ps with pcgChildScatter will leave you with a lot of pcgChildScatterivot_longer()s and ungroupcgChildScatter() and pcgChildScattercg.child.compcgChildScatterares.\nPick one word/format per concept. You turned a sprawling data frame into 3 manageable intermediate data frames based on groups of related measurements. Call them gesture.freqs, gesture.rates, and gesture.ratios rather than count.gestures, summ.rates.gestures, and grats.\nAvoid encodings. this is a little more complicated (look at the source link above for more), but the gist is that names should make sense on their own and not implicitly rely on knowing what other things in the code do. The purpose of the function mean_cgfq may be decipherable if you know that the dataframe child.gesture exists and contains a frequency variable, but out of context it’s a mystery.\n\n\n\nDocumentation\nDocumentation doesn’t usually need to be a major concern for beginner or intermediate programmers. However, you’ll be depending on a lot of documentation even if you’re not creating it yourself. As you start wading through the world of R packages, pay attention to the differences in documentation. Packages published to CRAN must adhere to minimum standards of documentation. Many larger packages will have their own websites or GitHub repos (in addition to CRAN) with extensive documentation, examples, and FAQs. Smaller independent and specialized packages might have extremely useful functions but leave you desperately trying to work out how to use them effectively.\nAny time you construct something usable – anything from a simple in-line function to a package to a shiny app – practice coherent documentation. Does your documentation look like the kind of documentation you find helpful? If you hand it off to a friend without any additional guidance can they figure out what to do with it?\nThink of multi-line comment chunks as a form of mini-documentation. Explain what the point of a script is at the top of a file, explain what the point of the function you’re defining is and what parameters it accepts just above the definition, etc."

It can be hard to know in the moment whether you’re writing a script you’ll never open again or one you’ll return to for years to come. Set yourself up for the latter.\n\nLifecycles\nR is constantly evolving, and R functions exist in “lifecycles.”\nIn general, you want to prioritize using functions that exist in the stable stage. A stable function is currently maintained, works with the most current version of R (and any dependent packages), and does not currently have a better option.\nNote the use of “current” in those descriptors, though. Any or all of those may change, and it’s important to keep on top of things in any code you hope to come back to in the future.\n\n\n\nLifecycle stages - sourced from lifecycle.r-lib.org\n\n\n\n\nR function lifecycle stages include:\n\nExperimental. This function is in development. Like beta software or an early access video game, this function may or may not be developed into a full, stable release. It may end up replacing currently stable functions, or it may be abandoned tomorrow. Experimental functions can be very helpful for very specific use-cases where stable functions don’t yet exist or aren’t sufficient, but you should use them with caution and add a comment noting that it’s experimental in case it breaks your code when something updates.\nStable. This function is currently operational, up-to-date, and maintained. This is the default stage, so unless the documentation indicates otherwise you can presume a function is stable. You should prioritize functions in the stable life stage.\nSuperseded. This function is still supported and isn’t going away any time soon, but it’s not going to get any further development. It is safe to use, but there is now an alternative stable function that is preferred for its use. A good example here is the gather and spread functions which have been superseded by pivot_longer and pivot_wider. Gather and spread were around for a long time and are essential to a lot of operational code, and a lot of people are used to them now and don’t really want to switch over to something new; it would be impractical to not support them. But the pivot options are just, well, better. If you have a good reason to favor a superseded function, go for it. If you’re not already familiar with it though, it’s wiser to spend your time learning the newer, stable replacement.\nDeprecated. This function works now but won’t for long. It may already not work with the current version of R, but still works with some operational older versions. Only use deprecated functions as a temporary last resort, and update with stable or experimental functions once you’re able.\n\nLearn more about lifecycles here.\n\nData lifecycle\nYour data don’t exist in quite such a formal “lifecycle,” but you can thing about them in a similar way as you try to future-proof your code:\n\nHow much could your data change?\n\nIncomplete datasets will get more data (e.g., pilot datasets -&gt; final datasets)\n“Complete” datasets may eliminate some data (e.g., retroactively excluding participants or measurement timepoints)\nVariables may need to be combined, anonymized, mutated, etc.\n\nHow similar are your data to other data?\n\nFollow-up studies and replications usually need to make minor (and sometimes major) changes to data format/organization\nProblems in data collection stage that are too late to change will mean new data format when they are fixed next time\nOther researchers in your area who could benefit from your code might use similar data collection methods but different organization methods\n\n\n\n\n\nDRY programming\n“DRY” programming stands for “Don’t Repeat Yourself.” Generally, stop copying and pasting! There are certainly merits to copy/paste when you’re making use of external code (e.g., from stackoverflow, chatGPT suggested code, forking a repo, your own old project), but DRY coding means minimizing repetition internally, within a single script or project.\nWhen you stay DRY, you:\n\nAvoid:\n\nPropogating mistakes that must be corrected individually\nDuplication conflicts\nCombing through verbose scripts for minor errors\n\nPromote:\n\nReplicable, reproducible code\nAbstracting code for multiple contexts of use\nCode usable by and relevant to other people and future-you\n\n\n\n\nAbstracted coding\n“Abstracting” in the sense of DRY coding usually refers to practices like defining one function to use repeatedly rather than copying and pasting the same block of code and changing variable names every time. Abstraction exists at a finer-grained level as well, such as with paths and variables. Generally, abstracted (relative) paths and variables are more durable that hard-coded (absolute) ones.\n\nPaths\nMaximally abstracted file path references minimize broken links. As an example:\n\nNatalie's Work MacBook/Users/Natalie/repos/d2m/example-repo/images/barplot.jpg\n\nOnly works on Natalie’s work computer no matter what\n\n~/repos/d2m/example-repo/images/barplot.jpg\n\nWorks on any machine if it’s cloned to this particular location\n\n/images/barplot.jpg\n\nWorks when you clone the repo anywhere as long as the internal structure is unmodified\n\n\n\n\nVariables\nYour data will change. You want to set yourself up for making as few changes as possible to accommodate changes to your data. This is the same logic as writing your manuscript in R Markdown with in-text code and references!\n\nmy_mean &lt;- (2 + 4)/2\n\nAlways equals 3\n\nx &lt;- 2 ; y &lt;- 4\u000bor x &lt;- 3 ; y &lt;- 10\u000bthe_mean &lt;- (x + y)/2\n\nOutput will change to reflect changes to 2 input variables\n\nnumber_list &lt;- c(2,3)\u000bor number_list &lt;- 2:8\u000bor number_list &lt;- c(1,2,8,100) ; \u000ba_mean &lt;- sum(number_list)/length(number_list)\n\nOutput will change no matter how many input numerals are averaged"

    "text": "Contextualized\n\nProgramming community “rules”\nA lot of “best practices” will apply across the board, but many will be dependent on smaller communities. R programmers don’t share exactly the same preferences for practices as C++ or Java coders. R statisticians don’t always (or ever) agree with Stats or SPSS users. Those of us working with data within academic research will have very different ideas of effective ways of organizing or presenting data “stories” than data analysts at start-ups or working in finance.\nFind your communities (plural) and do your best to respect their rules. This isn’t so much about gatekeeping and in-grouping (though it can certainty feel that way). It’s more about promoting collaboration. When everyone talks about their work in a similar way – whether it’s using the same style guide, preferring certain plots for certain analyses, opting for one package or another, formatting example random data, whatever – it’s much easier to work in forked repos, respond to crowd-sourced questions, understand others’ presentations, and just generally work together toward shared intentions.\nAlso you’ll appreciate the memes more.\n\n\nProject priorities\nAbove all else (or I guess below, since this is the bottom of the document, but I said this at the top too I think), the best code is the code that works. You have limited time and resources. You have needs and goals specific to your project and to you as an individual. People will refer to best practices “rules,” but they are called “best practices” for a reason. They are not hard and fast rules; they aren’t supposed to be. They are what should be relatively the most useful most of the time. Get in the practice of using these guidelines when you can, but ultimately this is not what your work is about.\nKeep your project’s goals as your top priorities. Consider the context of your work and accept that it’s not going to be exactly the same as any other context, and it will be vastly different from many. Make these guidelines work for you, stay flexible, and don’t worry if and when you need to just say screw this and move on with your life."

    "text": "Other\n\nNotebooks, Quarto, and Markdown\nDon’t use the visual editor!\nRemember everything will run top to bottom, just like a regular .R script. Right after your YAML header, your first chunks should 1) load all libraries, 2) set document defaults (optional), 3) set a random seed (optional), and 4) source any required external scripts in a sensible order.\n\nCode chunks\nCode chunks should:\n\nDo 1 and only 1 thing. A chunk should serve a single and transparent purpose. As a rule of thumb, if you can’t describe what your chunk does in 5 or fewer words, it should probably be more than one chunk. For example, one chunk might: assemble a ggplot, render a plot or table, import or export intermediate datasets, filter data for a specific purpose, print or store the output of a regression. This means you’ll sometimes need multiple chunks for things that at first feel like one big thing.\n\nExample: Include a demographics table in your document\n\nChunk 1: Create an intermediate dataset with only relevant demographic variables and observations\nChunk 2: Perform any alternations or calculations (e.g., summarize by gender groups, create income brackets)\nChunk 3: Store a basic kable or table\nChunk 4: Render the kable in the document with the aesthetic details you want\nBy separating it into multiple chunks, you can easily refer to distinct elements. Maybe you want to create the same demo table for a different dataset. Easy! You’ll have a new Chunk 1 but 2-4 are the same. Want to call a value from the table in the text? It’s pretty messy to pull that from the “pretty” kable you rendered, but it’s simple to pull from the basic kable skeleton you built in chunk 3. Want to print a complete demo table in one place and a summarized table somewhere else? Make an alternative version of chunk 2 for the second table.\n\n\nHave informative and unique names. Name your chunks to minimize human error. In addition to helping you stay organized, this will help tremendously with troubleshooting. Error messages during the knitting process don’t always give you the precise line number, but will always give you the chunk name where the problem occurred. (This is also a good reason to keep your chunks short and for 1 purpose only.) Aim to have the chunk name clearly indicate the one “thing” your chunk does. By default, I usually use verb-noun names: read-data, summarize-demos, build-child-table, build-gesture-bar-plot. The only exception (for me) is chunks that do the actual rendering of tables or plots, which I give a simple label matched to the chunk that built it (e.g., build-gesture-stacked-bar saves a plot to the variable gestureStackedBar which is then rendered in the chunk named fig-gesture-stacked-bar).\n\nCritically, your chunk names should be:\n\nUnique (knitr will throw an error for duplicate chunk names)\nInformative (fig-gesture-stacked-bar and not bar-graph)\nConventional (conservative and correct)\n\ne.g., R variables cannot start with a numeral, so even though chunk names legally can, it’s better to avoid it\nDon’t use underscores or spaces. Even if they “work” they often won’t work. Stick to . and - as separators.\n\n\n\nSpecify whether/how they should run and print. Many chunk options are available here, but at a basic level use echo and include to tell knitr to show/hide your code and/or output and use eval to say whether to run the code at all. You can easily change these chunk settings in RStudio by clicking the gear icon in the top right corner of any chunk.\n\nShow output only: echo=FALSE\nShow code and output: echo=TRUE\nShow nothing (run the code without printing anything): include=TRUE\nShow nothing and do not run code (just ignore the whole chunk): eval=FALSE, include=FALSE\n\nBe placed at the point they are needed or referenced. In theory, you could place every single chunk at the top of the file so long as they are in the correct order relative to each other. In practice, that’s impossible to manage. The beauty of R notebooks is the seamless integration of code and narrative, making the whole thing as human-friendly as it is machine-friendly. Keep your chunks as close as possible to the point in the narrative that they are referenced to easily edit both narrative and code as you work.\nBe (relatively) short, sourcing longer scripts if necessary. Using source() will run the full code of another file. Long blocks of code or instances where the purpose of code really can’t follow the “one-chunk-one-thing” rule may call for sourcing the code as a separate script. This is especially useful for:\n\nCode that you know you will rarely or never need to make dynamic edits to, like a script that imports multiple .csv files, wrangles many sources of data, and produces multiple intermediate datasets that will be the essential data for your whole manuscript.\nScripts that you run often that aren’t project specific. For example, I have a generic startup.R script I source that loads my most commonly used libraries, sets my preferred ggplot theme tweaks, and defines color palettes.\nDedicated scripts for defining all the custom functions necessary for the project. Nearly all of my projects source a functions.R script, which all start from a basic file that has functions I use in most projects (like one that calculates SD/SE and adds error bars to plots).\n\n\n\n\n\nGitHub & Collaboration\n\nInclude and maintain both a .gitignore and README.md file in the top level of your repository\nMake purposeful and wise decisions about managing public, private, and protected data and files\nUse informative commit messages\nPull before you start editing; commit as you work; push when you close your session\n\n\n\n\nGit xkcd\n\n\n\n\nNever forget that the whole point of using GitHub is version control! \nDo not create a new file for each assignment. Your repo is the home of your research project, not a collection of notes and homework. Keep it organized, future-proof, collaborator-friendly, and contextualized beyond this class."

Forking, however, is intended to facilitate collaboration and sharing of code. This is great for open source projects, but presents problematic limitations for the purposes of this class where everyone is working individually.\nInstead you will clone the repository and set up an upstream connection to mimic the behavior of a fork. This is a workaround for the limitations (or features, depending on your perspective) of GitHub’s permissions system.

This is a bit of a hack, but it’s the best way to keep your work private while still being able to pull in updates from the main repo.\nIn a forked repository, the “upstream” repo is the original repo that you forked from, the one you don’t own and don’t want to push to (at least not by default). The “origin” repo is your fork, the one you do own and do want to push to.\nHere we need to configure git to replicate that behavior, but with a clone instead of a fork.\nConvert the current origin to the upstream source repo:\ngit remote rename origin upstream\nWhat you’re doing: This renames the original remote to “upstream”, which is the convention for the original (source) repo in a forked repo setup.\nSet the new origin URL to point to your new repository, using the URL of the repository you created in Step 1:\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-NEW-CLONE-REPO.git\nWhat you’re doing: Since you renamed the original remote to “upstream”, you are now free to add a new remote called “origin”, which is the convention for the forked repo in a forked repo setup.\nConfigure the new origin to push to the main branch:\ngit push -u origin main\nWhat you’re doing: This command pushes your local main branch to the new remote origin and sets it as the default upstream branch. This means that in the future, pushing and pulling with the RStudio interface (or with the git push and git pull commands) will default to pushing and pulling to and from the main branch of your new private repo."

    "text": "Step 2; Option 2: Clone from your old fork first\nIf you already have a fork that you’ve worked in, you can clone it into a new local repo then change the remotes to mimic the behavior of a fork.\nIf you don’t have a fork or you want to start from scratch, follow the instructions above in Step 2; Option 1.\nIn this option you’re not actually cloning the repo like you would have if you cloned the upstream repo like in the directions above. What you’re actually doing is:\n\ncloning your remote (i.e., associated with a github repo) fork repo into a new local (i.e., only existing on your computer) repo\nassigning the upstream repo to mimic fork behavior\nturning the local repo into a new remote repo that you own\n\nThis is like duplicating the folder on your computer that contains all your repo files, but it has the added benefit of keeping the git history.\nOpen the RStudio project for your forked repo When you clone your new local repo, it will be created as a new folder in the working directory. You’ll want to be sure you’re in your home directory (or a directory where you keep all your repos) before you clone the new repo.\nIf you’re working in an RProject, the working directory is set to that project’s directory, so you’ll need to change it. Start by closing the project you have open by clicking the dropdown in the top right corner of the screen and choosing “close project.” Then open the terminal pane and enter the command pwd to see the current working directory. If it’s not your home directory (e.g., /Users/Natalie), navigate there by entering cd ~. Alternatively, you can navigate to a directory where you keep all your repos by entering cd path/to/your/repos (e.g., cd ~/Documents/repos, which will print as /Users/Natalie/Documents/repos).\nTake note of your working directory so that you can easily locate the cloned directory later. Run the following command to clone the forked repo into a new local repo:\ngit clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-FORK.git YOUR-NEW-CLONE-REPO\nHere, https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-FORK.git is the URL of your old, forked repo, which is what you’d see if you went to that repo on GitHub and clicked the green “Code” button to get the URL. YOUR-NEW-CLONE-REPO is the name of the new directory that will be created on your computer. This is not the URL of the new private repo you created in Step 1, but it will eventually become that. That means what you enter in this command is just a folder name, not a URL, and it should match whatever you named the new private repo in Step 1.\nWhat you’re doing: This command clones the forked repo into a new directory called YOUR-NEW-CLONE-REPO on your computer. This is a new, local repo that is not connected to any remote repositories. You should find the folder in the same directory as your forked repo.\nCreate a new RStudio project for the new private clone repo. Do not use the “version control” method to create the project. Instead, create a project with the “existing directory” option and navigate to the directory where you cloned the forked repo (e.g., ~/d2mr-assessment-nrdowling-clone). Open the project and make sure you can see all the files from your old fork in the “Files” pane. I recommend not opening it in a new session, so you don’t have both the fork and the clone projects open at once and accidentally work in the wrong one.\nConnect your new local repo to the source, upstream repo you want to maintain a connection with. In the terminal pane, enter the command:\ngit remote add upstream https://github.com/nrdowling/d2mr-assessment.git\nWhat you’re doing: This command adds a new remote called “upstream” that points to the original, source repo. This is the convention for the original repo in a forked repo setup.\nConnect your new local repo to the bare remote repo you made in Step 1. In the terminal pane, navigate to the directory of the new private repo (it will be in the same directory as your fork’s repo) and run the following command using the URL of the new private clone repo you created in Step 1:\ngit remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-NEW-CLONE-REPO.git\n\n_**What you're doing:** This command changes the URL of the remote called \"origin\" to point to the new private remote GitHub repo you created._\n\nDo a quick check to make sure the remotes are set up correctly:\ngit remote -v\nYou should see something like this:\norigin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-NEW-CLONE-REPO.git (fetch)\norigin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-NEW-CLONE-REPO.git (push)\nupstream https://github.com/nrdowling/d2mr-assessment.git (fetch)\nupstream https://github.com/nrdowling/d2mr-assessment.git (push)  \nOpen your git pane in RStudio and confirm that there are no files waiting to be committed. If there are, commit them with a message like “initial commit of cloned repo” or something similar.\nAssuming everything looks good, push your local repo to the new private repo:\ngit push -u origin --all\nWhat you’re doing: This command pushes all the branches and tags to the new remote repo and sets the default upstream branch to main.\nUsually this command runs without merge conflicts (since you’re pushing to an empty repo), but if you do get a conflict, you’ll need to resolve it before you can push. Follow the directions for resolving merge conflicts in the Workflow in your new repo section below.\nYou only need to run the commands in this step once to set up the new private clone repo. From now on, you can work in the new private repo as you would in a forked repo, pulling in updates from the original repo, making changes, and pushing your work to your own private repo.\nIf you try to run these commands again, you’ll get an error message that the remotes already exist. That’s fine; it just means you’ve already set them up correctly."

This is a personal preference, but it can help keep your commit history clean and linear.\nMerging with “ff” means that your commits are simply added to the end of the commit history. This can make it difficult to track changes and can lead to a messy commit history. The merge can fail if there are conflicts, rather than giving you a chance to resolve them.\nMerging with “rebase” temporarily removes your commits, pulls in the changes from the remote, and then reapplies your commits on top. This can make it easier to track changes and keep your commit history clean. The merge will pause if there are conflicts, allowing you to resolve them before continuing.\nThe workflow steps below assume that you have set pull.rebase to true. If you prefer not to set rebase as your default, you may need to modify some things to rebase manually at certain points."

    "text": "Step 4: Workflow in your new repo\nNow you can work in your new private repo as you would in a forked repo. You can pull in updates from the original repo, make changes, and push your work to your own private repo.\nEvery session working in RStudio should begin with pulling in commits from the upstream repo (and your cloned repo if necessary), involve frequent committed changes as you work, and end with pushing your changes to your private repo.\nBy “session” I mean a period of time when you are actively working on the repo, not the time that RStudio is open. I mean “start and end a session of work.” You can have multiple sessions in a day, and you should pull at the start and push at the end of each one. Leave RStudio open forever if you want, but commit and push every time you’re going to take a break from your work or switch to a different task for more than a few minutes.\n\nStart a session\nOpen RStudio and open the project you created in Step 2.\nPull in updates from your repo clone if there is any possibility that changes were made remotely to your own repo (e.g., if you were working on a different computer). You can do so either by clicking “Pull” in the RStudio interface or by running the following command in the terminal: git pull origin main.1\nPull in updates from the original, source repo:\ngit pull upstream main\nWhat you’re doing: This command fetches the changes from the main branch of the upstream repo and merges them into your local main branch. This is the equivalent of clicking “Pull” in the RStudio interface for your origin/private repo, but for the source/upstream repo.\nYou can also do the fetch and merge separately:\ngit fetch upstream\ngit merge upstream/main\nThe advantage of doing this in two steps is that you can see the changes that are fetched before you merge them. This can be helpful if you want to review the changes before merging them. Most of the time you can just do the fetch and merge in combined “pull” step.\nResolve merge conflicts with rebase (if necessary). If you get a message that there are conflicts, you will need to resolve them and then continue the rebase. There are many ways to resolve conflicts, but we’ll cover how to do it in the RStudio editor here:\n\nIdentify which files have conflicts by looking at the output of the rebase command. You can also see these files listed in the “Git” tab in RStudio; right click and choose “open file” to take you to the editor (or open them like normal from the files pane).\nLook for the conflict markers (&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;, =======, &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;) in the file. These indicate the sections of the file that are in conflict. The text above the equal signs is the version of the code from the source repo, and the text below the equal signs is the version of the code from your repo.\nFor each conflict, decide which version of the code you want to keep. Delete the conflict markers and any code/text you don’t want to keep. Save the file(s).\nStage the resolved files by clicking the “Stage” button in the “Git” tab in RStudio. Do not commit here, just stage.\nContinue the rebase by clicking the “Continue rebase” button in the “Git” tab in RStudio or with the command git rebase --continue in the terminal.\nRebase will attempt to merge one commit at a time, so if you have made multiple commits between the last time you pulled from the upstream repo and now, you may need to repeat this process for each commit that has conflicts.\n\nYou may get a prompt in the terminal to enter a commit message for the merge commit. This is the message that will be associated with the merge commit that resolves the conflicts. You can use the default message that appears in the editor, or you can write your own.\nTo enter your own message, press i to enter insert mode, type your message, then press esc to exit insert mode. To save (write) and exit (quit), type :wq and press enter.\nTo use the default, just type :wq.\n\n\nWork in the session\nDo whatever you’re going to do in the session. Make changes, add files, whatever. After every notable change, you should commit your changes using an informative commit message.\nCommit your changes with a descriptive message. In the Git pane, open up the “commit” window. Select any files that have been changed that you can describe with a single message. Write a descriptive message in the “Commit message” box. Click “Commit”.\nYou don’t have to commit changes to all edited files at once. You can commit changes to different files in separate commits. For example, you did a lot of data wrangling work across multiple files and file types. You could just check off all files and include a single commit message: Data wrangling for gesture count data. Or you could commit just the .R scripts (commit: added wrangling pipeline for creating minimal gesture count df), then the .csv files (commit: minimal gesture count dfs; removed speech data), then the .qmd manuscript file (commit: added simple table to results section using new minimal df).\nYou can push your committed changes to your private repo at any time by clicking “Push” in the RStudio interface. It’s not necessary to do this after every commit, but it’s a good idea to do it regularly to keep your work backed up and it doesn’t hurt.\n\n\nEnd the session\nAlways end a session by committing your changes and pushing them to your private repo. This ensures that your work is backed up and that you can access it from other computers.\nCommit any changes you’ve made since the last commit.\nPush your changes to your private repo by clicking “Push” in the RStudio interface."

You can view them in the student hub or accept any as GH Classroom assignments via links on the menu. After this week, you’re ready to start any of them, but most have elements that we won’t cover until weeks 6 & 7 (working with stringr and forcats).\n\nclean-level-1-mtcars: Structured exercise to introduce data manipulation in the tidyverse. Primarily uses dplyr and tidyr, but includes some manipulation of strings and factors as well\nclean-level-2-midwest: Open-ended with a general goal but no step-by-step instructions. Similar content to level 1.\nclean-group: Group project where each member makes a clean dataset messy, then cleans another member’s messy dataset following tidy data principles.\nwrangle-level-1-starwars: Structured exercise to go further into data wrangling. Includes a mix of dplyr, tidyr, stringr, and forcats.\nwrangle-level-2-gapminder: Open-ended with a general goal but no step-by-step instructions. Similar content to level 1.\nwrangle-group: (Similar to the group cleaning) Group project where each member un-wrangles a dataset, then wrangles another member’s dataset to as close to the original as possible.\nrecreate-function: A more advanced, freeform project where you pick a function from an R package and try to recreate it using tidyverse tools. Complex, and good for showing R programming & tidyverse objectives at a high level at the same time.\n\nCheck in on your accountability plans. Submit your mid-quarter reflection and updated plan to Canvas by next Monday, February 2nd.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHousekeeping\n\n\n\n\nAnnouncements:\n\nGitHub Submission: I promised a screen recording of the github submission process, but have not had time to make it yet. I’ll make a Slack announcement when it’s ready. In the meantime, you can follow the extremely detailed written instructions.\n\nNeed help sooner? Ask the class on Slack! Some students have already figured it out and can give you guidance. Many students are still very confused, so if you’re the one to ask for help you’re doing lots of people a big favor.\n\nSubmitted assignments: Qilong and I are double-grading early submissions to make sure we’re on the same page with grading standards. If you submitted early and haven’t received feedback yet, don’t worry – we’re working on it and will get to you as soon as we can!"

Do not create the repo within the D2M-R organization. Add prof+TA as collaborators before submitting your first draft.\nTake a look at the to-do from last week for tips to get started.\n\nExplore the R Programming core projects. You can view them in the student hub or accept any as GH Classroom assignments via links on the menu.\n\nadoption-day is a good one to start with if you want a guided introduction to writing functions in R.\nhello-world is a version of the classic exercise to get you familiar with R syntax and function structure. It has clear and simple goals but less step-by-step instruction.\nwrangling-function is more advanced, and it better suited to students who have some familiarity with base R and dplyr already. For most students, it will be better to come back to this one in Week 5 or later.\n\nReview the newly added suggestions for enrichment activities in the student hub. Most can be begun at any time, and several are best suited to continuing across at least a few weeks or the whole quarter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHousekeeping\n\n\n\n\nReminders:\n\nKeep track of your accountability plan!

It’s acceptable to add code that arbitrarily reads and writes just to meet the requirement\nThis has to be code you write yourself. If an assignment comes pre-loaded with code that reads/writes to relative paths, that does not demonstrate your ability to do this. If it prompts you to write the code (e.g., “Use read_csv() to read in the data from your data subdirectory”), that is you writing the code yourself and is acceptable"

There is no fixed list of additional requirements for the 6-point level; rather, you should aim to exceed expectations in multiple areas of your RStudio and Quarto workflow. Some ways you might do this include:\n\nCreating a more sophisticated project organization with nested subdirectories and clear documentation of the structure\nConfiguring your YAML header with options beyond the defaults (e.g., toc, number-sections, theme, code-fold, df-print, etc.)\nUsing advanced chunk options to create more complex behaviors (e.g., conditional execution, caching, cross-referencing figures and tables)\nImplementing custom YAML configurations for specialized output (e.g., APA formatting with apaquarto, custom CSS/LaTeX styling, parameterized reports)\nUsing inline R code extensively to create dynamic narrative text that updates automatically with your data\nCreating multiple output formats from the same .qmd file with format-specific customization\nDemonstrating advanced Quarto features such as tabsets, margin content, cross-references, or custom layouts\nIncluding comprehensive code comments and markdown documentation that explain your workflow and decisions\nCreating a detailed README.md file that documents your project structure, dependencies, and workflow\n\n\nAdditional Evidence Beyond Assignments\nYou can include additional evidence beyond what is contained in the assignment repo to demonstrate your proficiency with RStudio + Quarto workflow. Examples of additional evidence include:\n\nScreenshots showing effective use of RStudio, like the organization of files and folders or customization of the RStudio interface\nBrief explanation of how you manage your RStudio projects and Quarto documents for different assignments\nShort screen recording demonstrating your RStudio workflow, including how you create projects, manage files, and knit Quarto documents, accompanied by a brief written description of the video\nWritten reflection (200-300 words) on your experience using RStudio and Quarto for assignments, highlighting any challenges you faced and how you overcame them\nComparison of different output formats (HTML, PDF, Word) generated from the same Quarto document, discussing the pros and cons of each format for different types of assignments\nSummary of best practices or tips and tricks you’ve developed for using RStudio and Quarto effectively in your coursework, such as keyboard shortcuts, package management, or version control integration\nDemonstration of advanced Quarto features, such as parameterized reports, custom templates, or interactive elements, showcasing your ability to enhance your documents beyond basic functionality\n\nWhat counts as “advanced” will differ by quarter. Anything on the syllabus for D2M-R II will count as advanced for D2M-R I (e.g., using the apaquarto extension, citing with BibTeX, using chunk options to customize figure output). In D2M-R II you will be expected to go beyond what is covered in the syllabus (e.g., creating a website with Quarto and GitHub pages, creating an interactive dashboard, using Quarto extensions other than apaquarto)"

For example, if the number assigned in on GitHub does not match Canvas, or if you clearly demonstrated a skill at a high level but the skill does not have any comments or score attached at all.\nYou may not use the PR (or any other communication) to request resubmission or argue that you deserve a better grade. Outside of clear cases of simple human error, grades will not be changed after they are posted."

Instead, they give you a way to recover or add points if you choose a more structured path or if some standards land at the 4‑point level.\nThis is effectively up to 10 points of extra credit, but I don’t like thinking about these skills or these kinds of experiences as “extra.” I believe this category is as valuable as the core skills, but necessarily fuzzier and more open-ended. These 10 optional points are a way for you to customize your curriculum in this class to your own interests and goals.\nExamples include:\n\nDebugging journals that document how you worked through specific problems\nShort write‑ups teaching a peer how to do something (e.g., connecting RStudio and GitHub)\nSimple documentation for your own utility functions\nReflections on responsible and productive use of AI tools in your workflow\nEvidence of sustained collaboration on GitHub (e.g., issues, pull requests, code review)\nShort explorations of advanced R packages or techniques beyond the core curriculum\nIdentifying a need in your own research workflow and designing a solution using R\nDiscovering and effectively making use of specialized R packages for your specific needs\nMini‑projects that apply course skills to your own research questions (must be different from your final data project)\nContributions to open‑source R packages or communities (e.g., GitHub issues, Stack Overflow answers)\n\nThis is not a comprehensive list, and really the more creative and customized you approach this, the more useful it will be for your own learning (and the easier it will be to earn points). If you have an idea for an enrichment activity that isn’t listed here, send an email to Dr. Dowling to confirm that it is appropriate before you start working on it.\nYou may submit evidence for enrichment points up to 5 times during the quarter. Evidence may be in the form of a dedicated project (e.g., a debugging journal) or as a companion to another assignment (e.g., writing up how you used AI tools to help solve a problem in a core standards assignment). Points will be awarded based on overall quality and depth, which may look like creativity, independent learning, clear communication, thoughtful self-evaluation, or other dimensions depending on the nature of the activity.

Look at the examples if you need inspiration. Remember that ultimately these plans are for you, not me, so they should be in a form that you’ll actually use. Make them fancy, make them minimal. Copy and paste directly from the examples, write a few sentences for each element, or make a full database with day by day planning. Don’t force yourself into a format that will be more overwhelming than functional.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 2 | Git & GitHub\n\n\n\n\nJan-13; Jan-15\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview\n\n\n\n\nClass plans:\n\nTuesday: Introduction to the Git & GitHub (mostly slides)\n\nNow that you’ve got it set up, actually learning what it is.\n\nThursday: Finish slides if needed + hands-on practice with Git & GitHub\n\nCreate a repository, make changes, commit, push, pull, etc.\nQ&A/demo as needed for RStudio and GitHub\n\nDepending on need/interest, we can use Tuesday or Thursday to do a more involved RStudio and Quarto introduction.\n\nThat would make it a very dense week for slides trying to fit all of Git/GitHub into 1 day, but it’s doable.\n\n\nPrimary learning objectives:\n\n\nRStudio + Quarto workflow\n\n\nGitHub repositories and version control\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterials & Resources\n\n\n\n\nClass Materials:\n\nGit & GitHub Slides\nRStudio & Quarto Slides\nCourse guides:\n\nUsing GitHub with RStudio\nGuided Exercise: Create and Sync a GitHub Repo with RStudio\n\nTextbook\n\nReminder: The textbook is in its infancy!

Do not create the repo within the D2M-R organization. Add prof+TA as collaborators before submitting your first draft.\nAll you need at this point to get started is a name. Hopefully you have a plan for what data you’ll be using, which should be enough to form a sensible name. Though it’s generally not recommended if you can avoid it, you can change the name later (via GitHub settings) if needed, so there’s really no reason to wait on this.\nStart by adding the essential files:\n\nREADME.md and .gitignore can be created when you make the repo on GitHub or added later via RStudio\nCreate a manuscript Quarto file (e.g., manuscript.qmd) in the root directory.\nAdd a /data folder with any data files you have ready to go – be sure they are anonymized and safe to upload to a private repo first!\n\nAdd some content (real or placeholder) to your readme and manuscript files so you have something to commit and push. Experiment with simple markdown formatting in both files (e.g., headings, bold/italic text, lists, links, etc.) and add a code chunk to the manuscript file.\nRemember the cardinal rules of Git: Pull when you sit down. Commit more than you think you should. Push when you stand up.\n\nExplore the Skeleton Repo core skills project. You can complete this right now to get points for objectives 1 & 2, or start it now and build it up over the next couple weeks to add points toward objectives 3-5 (or more).\n\nSkeleton Repo core skills project instructions\nNote that this project requires creating a private repo from scratch in the D2M-R organization. There is no GitHub Classroom assignment option.\n\n\nRecommendation:\n\nMake a few human friends in class and form a study or accountability group. This will be a nice supplement your new rubber duck friend and open up options for group projects later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHousekeeping\n\n\n\n\nOffice Hours:\n\nDr. Dowling: Thurs 2-4pm, 1155 Bld.

After this week, you’re ready to start any of them, but most have elements that we won’t cover until weeks 6 & 7 (working with stringr and forcats).\n\nclean-level-1-mtcars: Structured exercise to introduce data manipulation in the tidyverse. Primarily uses dplyr and tidyr, but includes some manipulation of strings and factors as well\nclean-level-2-midwest: Open-ended with a general goal but no step-by-step instructions. Similar content to level 1.\nclean-group: Group project where each member makes a clean dataset messy, then cleans another member’s messy dataset following tidy data principles.\nwrangle-level-1-starwars: Structured exercise to go further into data wrangling. Includes a mix of dplyr, tidyr, stringr, and forcats.\nwrangle-level-2-gapminder: Open-ended with a general goal but no step-by-step instructions. Similar content to level 1.\nwrangle-group: (Similar to the group cleaning) Group project where each member un-wrangles a dataset, then wrangles another member’s dataset to as close to the original as possible.\nrecreate-function: A more advanced, freeform project where you pick a function from an R package and try to recreate it using tidyverse tools. Complex, and good for showing R programming & tidyverse objectives at a high level at the same time.\n\nCheck in on your accountability plans. Submit your mid-quarter reflection and updated plan to Canvas by next Monday, February 2nd.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHousekeeping\n\n\n\n\nAnnouncements:\n\nGitHub Submission: I promised a screen recording of the github submission process, but have not had time to make it yet. I’ll make a Slack announcement when it’s ready. In the meantime, you can follow the extremely detailed written instructions.\n\nNeed help sooner? Ask the class on Slack! Some students have already figured it out and can give you guidance. Many students are still very confused, so if you’re the one to ask for help you’re doing lots of people a big favor.\n\nSubmitted assignments: Qilong and I are double-grading early submissions to make sure we’re on the same page with grading standards. If you submitted early and haven’t received feedback yet, don’t worry – we’re working on it and will get to you as soon as we can!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 5 | Mid-quarter Review & R Workshops\n\n\n\n\nFeb-3; Feb-5\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview\n\n\n\n\nClass plans:\n\nFinish up tidyr slides\nIndependent and group work\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterials & Resources\n\n\n\n\nClass Materials:\nNone\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignments & To-Do\n\n\n\n\nThis weeks is for catching up on any missed work and getting ahead on the next few weeks.\nNow is a good time to preview other packages from the tidyverse (ggplot2, forcats, stringr, etc.) and start working on projects that use these packages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHousekeeping\n\n\n\n\nReminders:\n\nDid you turn in your accountability plan????"

You can view them in the student hub or accept any as GH Classroom assignments via links on the menu. After this week, you’re ready to start any of them, but most have have some tasks related to factor variables, which we’ll cover week 7.\n\nclean-level-1-mtcars: Structured exercise to introduce data manipulation in the tidyverse. Primarily uses dplyr and tidyr, but includes some manipulation of strings and factors as well\nclean-level-2-midwest: Open-ended with a general goal but no step-by-step instructions. Similar content to level 1.\nclean-group: Group project where each member makes a clean dataset messy, then cleans another member’s messy dataset following tidy data principles.\nwrangle-level-1-starwars: Structured exercise to go further into data wrangling. Includes a mix of dplyr, tidyr, stringr, and forcats.\nwrangle-level-2-gapminder: Open-ended with a general goal but no step-by-step instructions. Similar content to level 1.\nwrangle-group: (Similar to the group cleaning) Group project where each member un-wrangles a dataset, then wrangles another member’s dataset to as close to the original as possible.\nrecreate-function: A more advanced, freeform project where you pick a function from an R package and try to recreate it using tidyverse tools. Complex, and good for showing R programming & tidyverse objectives at a high level at the same time.\n\nWhere is your data project? We’re more than half-way through the quarter.\n\nBy this point you should minimally have a dedicated GitHub repository for your data project that syncs with an RStudio project. It should include the standard git repo files and structure (like your README and gitignore), data in the form of a .csv or other tablar file, and a Quarto notebook with a basic outline of the project.\nIdeally you also have one or more R scripts that do things like define functions and perform initial data read-in, wrangling, and write-out.\nIf you haven’t started yet, this needs to be a top priority.\nIf you have started, consider submitting whatever you have for feedback. Remember you absolutely do not have to have a complete project to submit (I strongly recommend you do not wait nearly that long!). Indicate what objectives you’re attempting and get clear feedback on whether you’re meeting expectations (and if not, how to do so). Even if you’re only attempting to demonstrate a few objectives, there’s no harm in getting guidance on what you have so far.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHousekeeping\n\n\n\n\n\nGitHub Submission: This is now a screen recording of the github submission process you can view here extremely detailed written instructions.\nHunter’s Plain-English Guide to R: Hunter has turned his notes into a Quarto document and allowed me to share it on the website. It’s a great resource for beginners and a nice complement to the textbook and lecture materials. You can find it here.\nExample data project: As I mentioned last week, I’m setting up an example data project that shows how to meet the basic requirements for the integrated data project. I have initialized that repo in the d2m-r github org, and you can view it here.\n\nNote: As of Feb 8 2026, this repo is not complete. It does not currently meet the requirements for the integrative data project! I’ll be updating it as I have time, but I wanted to share it in its current state in case it’s helpful to anyone as a starting point. I’ll make an announcement when it’s complete.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 7 | Tidyverse Data Wrangling, part 2\n\n\n\n\nFeb-17; Feb-19\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview\n\n\n\n\nClass plans:\nPrimary learning objectives:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterials & Resources\n\n\n\n\nClass Materials:\n\nSlides\nTextbook Chapter\n\n\nAdditional Resources:\n\nreadings\ncheat-sheets\ntutorials\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignments & To-Do\n\n\n\n\nGraded Submissions:\nRecommended Exercises:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHousekeeping\n\n\n\n\nAnnouncements:\nReminders:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 8 | Data Reporting Essentials\n\n\n\n\nFeb-24; Feb-26\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview\n\n\n\n\nClass plans:\nPrimary learning objectives:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterials & Resources\n\n\n\n\nClass Materials:\n\nSlides\nTextbook Chapter\n\n\nAdditional Resources:\n\nreadings\ncheat-sheets\ntutorials\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignments & To-Do\n\n\n\n\nGraded Submissions:\nRecommended Exercises:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHousekeeping\n\n\n\n\nAnnouncements:\nReminders:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 9 | Data Wrangling & Reporting Workshops\n\n\n\n\nMar-3; Mar-5\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview\n\n\n\n\nClass plans:\nPrimary learning objectives:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterials & Resources\n\n\n\n\nClass Materials:\n\nSlides\nTextbook Chapter\n\n\nAdditional Resources:\n\nreadings\ncheat-sheets\ntutorials\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignments & To-Do\n\n\n\n\nGraded Submissions:\nRecommended Exercises:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHousekeeping\n\n\n\n\nAnnouncements:\nReminders:"

Contrast base R’s inconsistent naming (grep, sub, gsub) with stringr’s consistent str_* pattern. stringr is vectorized by default and uses consistent argument ordering (string first, pattern second).\nWhat does it mean to be “vectorized by default?”\nIt means that stringr functions are designed to work with vectors of strings without needing to use sapply() or loops. You can pass a character vector to a stringr function, and it will operate on each element of the vector automatically, returning a vector of results. In contrast, many base R string functions are not vectorized and require additional steps to apply them to each element of a character vector."

Collapse is for combining elements of a single vector into one string.\nWhat’s the difference between sep and collapse? - sep: Specifies the string to use to separate individual elements when concatenating multiple strings together. It is used when you want to combine multiple strings into a single string with a specific separator between them. For example, str_c(\"hello\", \"world\", sep = \" \") will produce “hello world”. - collapse: Specifies the string to use to separate elements when collapsing a vector of strings into a single string. It is used when you have a vector of strings and want to combine them into one string with a specific separator between each element. For example, str_flatten(c(\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"), collapse = \", \") will produce “apple, banana, cherry”."

Since there is no pattern matching in this kind of extraction, there is no pattern to come first, so the string to search comes first. This is perfectly reasonable, but it can be confusing when you are used to the pattern-first convention of other string functions. In contrast, str_sub() follows the consistent structure of string as first argument. This consistency in argument order helps reduce confusion and makes it easier to remember how to use different functions within the stringr package. It also makes all stringr functions play nice in pipelines, where the result of one line is implicitly the first argument of the next.\nCoding challenge:\nUse regex, str_glue, and str_sub to detect the first occurrence of an animal and of an adjective in the sentence, extract them, and create a new string with them. For example, if the sentence is “The QUICK brown fox jumps over the LAZY dog.”, you could extract “fox” (animal) and “QUICK” (adjective) and create a new string like “Look at the QUICK fox!”\nR doesn’t know what “fox” or “LAZY” mean, so you’ll need to define what counts as an animal and an adjective for this challenge. The simplest way to do this is just to name the words directly in a vector or within the regex pattern, but you can try for a more adaptable or creative definition if you want to make it more interesting!\nChallengier:\nCreate a function that lets your user decide whether the resulting sentence should use the first or second occurrence of the animal and adjective. For example, if the user chooses “first”, the function would extract “QUICK” and “fox” to create “Look at the QUICK fox!”, but if they choose “second”, it would extract “LAZY” and “dog” to create “Look at the LAZY dog!”.\nYet even more challengier:\nAllow your user to specify first animal and second adjective (or vice versa), or to specify a different sentence to analyze. Make sure your function can handle cases where the specified occurrence doesn’t exist (e.g., if the user asks for the second animal but there is only one animal in the sentence) and provide informative error messages."

They can do a ton, but if this project is ultimately your responsibility, you need to have the foundations to work WITH it (and know how and when to give up and do it yourself when the AI is totally fucked)."

Since the data is unchanged, the data in the new variable is itself a table (or tibble). The columns in the nested tibble are the columns you passed to it and the rows are all the original rows within each “group”.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou probably won’t need this so don’t stress if that seems like gibberish.

    "text": "Data to Manuscript in R is a two-quarter sequence that covers the basic skills needed to build a research workflow with the R programming language to create reproducible, open-science friendly reports that can be easily updated with ongoing data collection or receiving comments from readers.\nThe course structure differs from traditional methods courses in its emphasis on hands-on skill development, cumulative assessment, and student-directed learning.\nThis page offers an at-a-glace overview of the course goals and structure. Detailed information about learning objectives, syllabus policies, and assessment structure are available on the course website.\n\n\nThe sequence emphasizes four interconnected goals:\n\nDevelop a reproducible and transparent research workflow. Plan, execute, and document a data analysis project from start to finish including data acquisition, cleaning, analysis, visualization, and reporting.\nPractice accountability & time management. Set realistic goals, create a plan to achieve them, monitor your progress, and adjust as needed.\nEngage with your research communities. Collaborate effectively with peers, contribute to group learning, and seek help when needed.\nDevelop problem-solving and independent learning skills. Develop specific strategies for debugging code, troubleshooting errors, asking good questions, and learning new skills independently using the myriad resources available online from R and open-science communities.\n\n\n\n\nBoth quarters of the sequence are best suited for students actively working on a quantitative research project like a BA or MA thesis.\nD2M-R I (Winter Quarter) focuses on the “Data” side of the workflow, with topics including core R programming, data wrangling in the Tidyverse, using GitHub for version control, and simple data analysis and visualization.\nPreparation:\n\nNo previous experience with R or programming is required.\nBest suited for students actively working on a quantitative research project like a BA or MA thesis.\nFinal data project may be completed with original or publicly available data.\nConsent required for undergraduates.\n\nCore learning objectives: RStudio + Quarto workflow, GitHub repositories and version control, Base R syntax and data structures, Control flow (if/else, loops), Defining functions in Base R, Importing data with tidyverse tools, Data manipulation with dplyr and pipelines, Tidy data structure, Reshaping data with tidyr, Character strings with stringr, Factors with forcats, Basic data reporting in Quarto\nD2M-R II (Spring Quarter) advances to the “Manuscript” side of the workflow, with topics including the application of statistical analyses commonly used in the social sciences, creating publication-quality plots with the ggplot2 package, and the integration of R code with dynamic narrative text via the open-source Quarto publishing system.\nPreparation:\n\nAssumes familiarity with R, the tidyverse ecosystem, and GitHub.\nData to Manuscript I is highly recommended, but not required.\nBest suited for students actively working on a quantitative research project like a BA or MA thesis.\nFinal data project must be completed with original data. Exceptions may be granted for publicly available data if the student has a sophisticated analysis plan.\nConsent required for undergraduates.\n\nCore learning objectives: Descriptive statistics and summary tables, Inferential statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, chi-square, correlation), Linear modeling (regression and GLMs), Advanced ggplot2 customization, Multi-panel figures, APA-formatted tables, Dynamic in-text references, BibTeX and citations, Advanced Quarto features, Custom function development, Manuscript-ready output, Reproducible project organization\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse materials, assignments, and student work live in GitHub repositories in the D2M-R GitHub organization. Students complete projects in private repos (both within the organization and through individual accounts). Many projects may be completed through GitHub Classroom assignments.\nStudents should sign up for a GitHub individual account with the education plan upgrade before the course begins.\n\n\n\nThe Canvas page is used for tracking grades, and little else.\n\n\n\nThe course website (d2m-r.github.io) serves as the primary reference, with guides, resources, and syllabus information.\nThe class calendar on the site’s home page is updated regularly with announcements, reminders, and links to each week’s readings and slides.\n\n\n\nD2M-R includes an early-in-development textbook covering everything in the D2M-R I & II syllabi. It starts with the first steps of getting RStudio to work then moves through topics like beginner and intermediate R programming, tidy data wrangling, visualization, statistical analysis, and creating reproducible, dynamic publications with Quarto.\nWhen relevant content is in the current version of the textbook, it will be assigned as a reading for the week. Where content is incomplete or missing, alternative readings from texts like R for Data Science, R for the Rest of Us, and Hands-On Programming with R.\nThe textbook is a work in progress—students can contribute improvements, corrections, or new content for course credit!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrade composition:\n\n20% Engagement: Independent accountability planning (10%) and community participation (10%)\n60% Core Data Skills Portfolio: Demonstration of 12 core standards through structured and unstructured projects from an assessment menu\n20% Integrative Data Project: Final project integrating all 12 standards\nUp to 10% Enrichment: Optional (bonus) supplemental skills and independent learning\n\nStudents select projects matching their skill level and interests, demonstrating competencies when ready rather than on fixed deadlines. Skills are assessed as meeting expectations (4pt), exceeding expectations (5pt), or outstanding (6pt).\n\n\n\nAssessment details are still being finalized for D2M-R II, but will follow a generally similar structure to D2M-R I.\nOne key difference is an emphasis on start-to-finish research, with more weight given to a longer, more complex, and highly polished data project.\n\n\n\n\nYou’ll need to bring a laptop to class every day with RStudio installed. Class sessions blend lecture, live coding demonstrations, and hands-on workshops. Students should have R, RStudio, Git, and GitHub configured by the end of Week 1.\nRequired software (all free):\n\nR (latest version)\nRStudio Desktop\nGit\nGitHub account\nSlack\nRecommended: GitHub Desktop for repository management when RStudio freaks out\n\nSetup guides and troubleshooting resources are available on the course website."

Skills are assessed as meeting expectations (4pt), exceeding expectations (5pt), or outstanding (6pt).\n\n\n\nAssessment details are still being finalized for D2M-R II, but will follow a generally similar structure to D2M-R I.\nOne key difference is an emphasis on start-to-finish research, with more weight given to a longer, more complex, and highly polished data project."

Collapse is for combining elements of a single vector into one string.\nWhat’s the difference between sep and collapse? - sep: Specifies the string to use to separate individual elements when concatenating multiple strings together. It is used when you want to combine multiple strings into a single string with a specific separator between them. For example, str_c(\"hello\", \"world\", sep = \" \") will produce “hello world”. - collapse: Specifies the string to use to separate elements when collapsing a vector of strings into a single string. It is used when you have a vector of strings and want to combine them into one string with a specific separator between each element. For example, str_flatten(c(\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"), collapse = \", \") will produce “apple, banana, cherry”."
