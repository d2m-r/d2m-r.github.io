    "text": "Data to Manuscript in R is a two-quarter sequence that covers the basic skills needed to build a research workflow with the R programming language to create reproducible, open-science friendly reports that can be easily updated with ongoing data collection or receiving comments from readers.\nThe course structure differs from traditional methods courses in its emphasis on hands-on skill development, cumulative assessment, and student-directed learning.\nThis page offers an at-a-glace overview of the course goals and structure. Detailed information about learning objectives, syllabus policies, and assessment structure are available on the course website.\n\n\nThe sequence emphasizes four interconnected goals:\n\nDevelop a reproducible and transparent research workflow. Plan, execute, and document a data analysis project from start to finish including data acquisition, cleaning, analysis, visualization, and reporting.\nPractice accountability & time management. Set realistic goals, create a plan to achieve them, monitor your progress, and adjust as needed.\nEngage with your research communities. Collaborate effectively with peers, contribute to group learning, and seek help when needed.\nDevelop problem-solving and independent learning skills. Develop specific strategies for debugging code, troubleshooting errors, asking good questions, and learning new skills independently using the myriad resources available online from R and open-science communities.\n\n\n\n\nBoth quarters of the sequence are best suited for students actively working on a quantitative research project like a BA or MA thesis.\nD2M-R I (Winter Quarter) focuses on the “Data” side of the workflow, with topics including core R programming, data wrangling in the Tidyverse, using GitHub for version control, and simple data analysis and visualization.\nPreparation:\n\nNo previous experience with R or programming is required.\nBest suited for students actively working on a quantitative research project like a BA or MA thesis.\nFinal data project may be completed with original or publicly available data.\nConsent required for undergraduates.\n\nCore learning objectives: RStudio + Quarto workflow, GitHub repositories and version control, Base R syntax and data structures, Control flow (if/else, loops), Defining functions in Base R, Importing data with tidyverse tools, Data manipulation with dplyr and pipelines, Tidy data structure, Reshaping data with tidyr, Character strings with stringr, Factors with forcats, Basic data reporting in Quarto\nD2M-R II (Spring Quarter) advances to the “Manuscript” side of the workflow, with topics including the application of statistical analyses commonly used in the social sciences, creating publication-quality plots with the ggplot2 package, and the integration of R code with dynamic narrative text via the open-source Quarto publishing system.\nPreparation:\n\nAssumes familiarity with R, the tidyverse ecosystem, and GitHub.\nData to Manuscript I is highly recommended, but not required.\nBest suited for students actively working on a quantitative research project like a BA or MA thesis.\nFinal data project must be completed with original data. Exceptions may be granted for publicly available data if the student has a sophisticated analysis plan.\nConsent required for undergraduates.\n\nCore learning objectives: Descriptive statistics and summary tables, Inferential statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, chi-square, correlation), Linear modeling (regression and GLMs), Advanced ggplot2 customization, Multi-panel figures, APA-formatted tables, Dynamic in-text references, BibTeX and citations, Advanced Quarto features, Custom function development, Manuscript-ready output, Reproducible project organization\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse materials, assignments, and student work live in GitHub repositories in the D2M-R GitHub organization. Students complete projects in private repos (both within the organization and through individual accounts). Many projects may be completed through GitHub Classroom assignments.\nStudents should sign up for a GitHub individual account with the education plan upgrade before the course begins.\n\n\n\nThe Canvas page is used for tracking grades, and little else.\n\n\n\nThe course website (d2m-r.github.io) serves as the primary reference, with guides, resources, and syllabus information.\nThe class calendar on the site’s home page is updated regularly with announcements, reminders, and links to each week’s readings and slides.\n\n\n\nD2M-R includes an early-in-development textbook covering everything in the D2M-R I & II syllabi. It starts with the first steps of getting RStudio to work then moves through topics like beginner and intermediate R programming, tidy data wrangling, visualization, statistical analysis, and creating reproducible, dynamic publications with Quarto.\nWhen relevant content is in the current version of the textbook, it will be assigned as a reading for the week. Where content is incomplete or missing, alternative readings from texts like R for Data Science, R for the Rest of Us, and Hands-On Programming with R.\nThe textbook is a work in progress—students can contribute improvements, corrections, or new content for course credit!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrade composition:\n\n20% Engagement: Independent accountability planning (10%) and community participation (10%)\n60% Core Data Skills Portfolio: Demonstration of 12 core standards through structured and unstructured projects from an assessment menu\n20% Integrative Data Project: Final project integrating all 12 standards\nUp to 10% Enrichment: Optional (bonus) supplemental skills and independent learning\n\nStudents select projects matching their skill level and interests, demonstrating competencies when ready rather than on fixed deadlines. Skills are assessed as meeting expectations (4pt), exceeding expectations (5pt), or outstanding (6pt).\n\n\n\nAssessment details are still being finalized for D2M-R II, but will follow a generally similar structure to D2M-R I.\nOne key difference is an emphasis on start-to-finish research, with more weight given to a longer, more complex, and highly polished data project.\n\n\n\n\nYou’ll need to bring a laptop to class every day with RStudio installed. Class sessions blend lecture, live coding demonstrations, and hands-on workshops. Students should have R, RStudio, Git, and GitHub configured by the end of Week 1.\nRequired software (all free):\n\nR (latest version)\nRStudio Desktop\nGit\nGitHub account\nSlack\nRecommended: GitHub Desktop for repository management when RStudio freaks out\n\nSetup guides and troubleshooting resources are available on the course website."

    "text": "The integrative data project requires you to demonstrate the full research workflow: data preparation, analysis, and manuscript reporting. You’ll build a reproducible pipeline from raw data to publication-ready output.\nThis differs from core standards projects, which focus on specific technical skills. The integrative project integrates everything across the quarter.\nYour dataset should be complete enough to support a full analysis pipeline—from data cleaning and transformation through statistical modeling to final visualization. Even in D2M-R I when we don’t cover advanced analysis, this should still be the goal for your data. This means having sufficient observations, relevant variables for your research questions, and enough complexity to demonstrate meaningful data wrangling skills without being so messy that cleaning becomes the entire project.\n\n\n“Your own data” means data you have a personal stake in analyzing as part of research you’re conducting or contributing to. This includes:\n\nThesis or dissertation data (BA, MA, or PhD)\nData from a lab you work in or research team you’re part of\nData you’re collecting for a faculty member’s project\nPilot data from studies you’re designing\nData from independent research projects\n\nIt does not necessarily have to be data you collected yourself, and it can even be data collected for an entirely different purpose. “Your” data just means it’s something you’re bringing to the table for your own work rather than trying to find something out there to make work for this class specifically.\nQuarter 1: Using your own data is strongly preferred. Students working with thesis data (BA or MA), lab projects, or ongoing research get the most from this course. You’ll build directly applicable skills and advance your actual research.\nQuarter 2: You are required to use your own data for the integrative project. You must have a dataset with personal investment and clear research questions before the start of the quarter.\nIf you lack your own data, publicly available datasets work for Quarter 1. However, start identifying your own dataset early—you’ll need it by Quarter 2.\n\n\n\nStart with your research question. Identify the domain (psychology, public health, social science) and core variables you need. This focus prevents getting lost in vast repositories.\nUse multiple search approaches:\n\nDomain-specific repositories (ICPSR, Roper, Journal of Open Psychology Data) offer curated, documented datasets\nMeta-search engines (Google Dataset Search, re3data.org) cast a wider net across repositories\nGeneral platforms (Harvard Dataverse, Figshare, Kaggle) provide diverse options with varying quality\nSpecialized collections (Data is Plural, Components, Awesome Public Datasets) surface interesting datasets you might not find otherwise\n\nEvaluate documentation quality. Well-documented datasets include codebooks, data dictionaries, and methodology descriptions. Poor documentation will cost you time and introduce errors.\nSee below for a list of public data collections to get started.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou need a dataset covering all variables for your analysis. If your research question requires demographics, behavioral measures, and temporal data, the dataset must include all three.\nPartial datasets work only if you can extract a complete subset. Pilot data with full variable coverage beats a larger dataset missing key variables.\n\n\n\nCheck for uniform column names, consistent date formats, and standardized categorical values. Inconsistencies like “Yes”/“yes”/“Y” or “01/15/2024”/“2024-01-15” create silent errors that corrupt analyses.\nInspect the first 50-100 rows for structural oddities before committing to a dataset. Structural inconsistency at the outset doesn’t need to be a dealbreaker, but it means you’ll have more work to do in data preparation stages.\n\n\n\nR processes plain text. While packages can read Excel or SPSS files, you’ll convert them to CSV or TSV eventually. Start with formats ending in .csv, .tsv, or .txt when possible.\nMost repositories offer CSV export. If only proprietary formats exist, verify conversion tools work before investing time in the dataset.\n\n\n\nData must organize into rows and columns. Standard tidy format (each column = variable, each row = observation) simplifies analysis, but transposed or nested structures work if convertible.\nSpreadsheets typically meet this criterion. Unstructured text or XML requires preprocessing.\n\n\n\nThe dataset must enable answering specific research questions. On day one, articulate 2-3 concrete questions the data can address.\nStudents with interesting research projects tend to be more interested in the work and generally learn more. Generic exploration of unfocused datasets produces generic insights.\n\n\n\nGitHub retains complete history. Only commit fully anonymized data. Never plan to “anonymize later.”\nFor human subjects data, verify no personally identifiable information exists. Random participant IDs, geographic aggregation to region level, and date jittering are standard approaches.\nIf you are using publicly available data from a credible source, you don’t have to worry about anonymization. However, if you are using your own data or “quasi-”open data (like from a large research project with collaborators at multiple institutions), you’ll need to be very careful about this.\nCheck with advisors about discipline-specific anonymization standards.\n\n\n\n\nDataset too large. Start with manageable size (under 100MB). You can always expand later.\nMissing codebook. Variable names like “V1”, “V2”, “Q37” without explanation make analysis impossible.\nAggregated data when you need individual observations. Summary statistics can’t be disaggregated.\nLicensing restrictions. Verify the dataset permits academic use and redistribution if needed.\nFormat mismatch. PDF tables or image-based data require extraction work that exceeds course scope.\n\n\n\nIf uncertain about dataset suitability, download it, examine the first few rows, and bring specific questions to Dr. Dowling or your TA. “Can this work?” questions need concrete examples, not abstract descriptions."

It’s ok if it’s just arbitrarily reading and writing just to meet the requirement.\nThis has to be code you write yourself. If an assignment comes pre-loaded with code that reads/writes to relative paths, that is not demonstrating your ability to do this yourself. If it prompts you to write the code (e.g., “Use read_csv() to read in the data from your data subdirectory”), that is you writing the code yourself and is acceptable.\n\n\nintermediate (5 points) - [ ]\nadvanced (6 points) - [ ]\nYou can include additional evidence beyond what is contained in the assignment repo to demonstrate your proficiency with RStudio + Quarto workflow. Examples of additional evidence include:\n\nScreenshots showing effective use of RStudio, like the organization of files and folders or customization of the RStudio interface\nBrief explanation of how you manage your RStudio projects and Quarto documents for different assignments\nShort screen recording demonstrating your RStudio workflow, including how you create projects, manage files, and knit Quarto documents, accompanied by a brief written description of the video.\nWritten reflection (200-300 words) on your experience using RStudio and Quarto for assignments, highlighting any challenges you faced and how you overcame them.\nComparison of different output formats (HTML, PDF, Word) generated from the same Quarto document, discussing the pros and cons of each format for different types of assignments.\nSummary of best practices or tips and tricks you’ve developed for using RStudio and Quarto effectively in your coursework, such as keyboard shortcuts, package management, or version control integration.\nDemonstration of advanced Quarto features, such as parameterized reports, custom templates, or interactive elements, showcasing your ability to enhance your documents beyond basic functionality.\n\nWhat counts as “advanced” will differ by quarter. Anything on the syllabus for D2M-R II will count as advanced for D2M-R I (e.g., using the apaquarto extension, citing with BibTeX, using chunk options to customize figure output). In D2M-R II you will be expected to go beyond what is covered in the syllabus (e.g., creating a website with Quarto and GitHub pages, creating an interactive dashboard, using Quarto extensions other than apaquarto)."

You aren’t expected to be able to demonstrate a skill before we cover it in class, so early submissions may only demonstrate a subset of the standards. That’s fine! Submitting a draft that shows only a few objectives will let you confirm that you are in fact meeting expectations for those objectives and will give you guidance on where to go next.\nGrades for resubmissions will replace previous scores.

Only the final submission will receive a grade, but all three submissions are required to earn full credit.\n\n\n\nDue\nComponent\n\n\n\n\nWeek 2\nInitial accountability plan\n\n\nWeek 5\nMid-quarter reflection & plan update\n\n\nWeek 8\nFinal reflection & plan update\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccommodations\n\n\n\nIf you have accommodations through the Student Disability Services (SDS) for extended deadlines, you should build these into your accountability plan. For example, you could set 2 deadlines for each planned submission (target and extended) or just add a note about how you will commit to meeting your goals given your accommodations (e.g., allowing for a default extension of X days on all deadlines). Ultimately, you’ll be the one reflecting on your progress and suggesting a grade. You are responsible for staying accountable to yourself to meet the broad learning objectives stated above, but you have control over what that will look like.\nIf you struggle with this kind of planning, whether or not you have SDS accommodations, I recommend starting with one of the example accountability plans. Personalize it to the extent you feel comfortable, or just leave it as-is if the idea of a self-paced course is overwhelming.\n\n\n\nInitial Plan\nDue: Monday, January 12th, 2026\nCreate an individual accountability plan to follow throughout the quarter. The way you structure your plan is up to you, but it should minimally lay out your targets, timeline, and priorities for the quarter. To get started, think about questions like:\n\nTargets: What is your target grade for the course? How many points do you plan to earn in each category (core standards, data project, enrichment, community engagement, accountability)? Will you aim for mostly 4s, 5s, or 6s on core standards? Will you plan on “buffer” points?\nTimeline: When do you plan to complete each core standard? When will you work on your data project? When will you decide whether to ? How will you space out your work to avoid last-minute stress?\nPriorities: Which standards or activities are most important to you? Are there any that you expect to be particularly challenging? How will you allocate your time and energy accordingly?\n\nI recommend also incorporating one or more less measurable elements:\n\nStrategies: What strategies will you use to stay on track? Will you set specific weekly goals? Use a planner or calendar? Seek support from peers or instructors?\nContingencies: How will you handle unexpected challenges or changes in your schedule? What will you do if you fall behind or need to adjust your plan?\nMotivation: Why is this course important to you? What are your personal or professional goals related to data analysis and R programming? How will you stay motivated throughout the quarter?\n\nThe only requirements are that you 1) define elements #1-3 in some way and 2) submit the initial reflection by Monday of Week 2. If you join the course in Week 2 or later, contact Dr. Dowling to set a modified deadline.\n\n\nMid-Quarter Reflection & Plan Update\nDue: Monday, February 2nd, 2026\nReflect on your progress toward your accountability plan and update it as needed. Submit a revised accountability plan that includes:\n\nA summary of your progress so far, including what you have completed and any challenges you faced.\nAn updated timeline for the rest of the quarter, including any changes to your targets or priorities.\nAny new strategies or contingencies you have developed based on your experiences so far.\n\n\n\nFinal Reflection & Plan Update\nDue: Monday, February 23rd, 2026\nReflect on your overall progress throughout the quarter and submit a final accountability plan that includes:\n\nA summary of your overall progress, including what you have completed and any challenges you faced.\nA clear list of what you need to do before the quarter ends to meet your goal, and a timeline for completing those tasks.\nA reflection on what you learned about accountability and time management during the course, including any strategies that worked well for you and areas for improvement in the future.\nA suggested grade (0-10 points) based on your performance in meeting the broad learning objectives related to accountability and time management.\n\nRemember that your grade for this is based on the two broad learning objectives about developing a research workflow and staying accountable to yourself. This is not about what specific learning objectives you met or how satisfied you are with the work you have delivered. It’s possible that you did amazing work but struggled with accountability, or that you failed to demonstrate technical skills but still developed strong habits for planning and follow-through.\nSimilarly, the grade you assign yourself should be based primarily on how you used the plan, not the quality of the initial plan. If you started the class with a poor understanding of how much time and effort would be required, but you adjusted your plan and successfully met your goals, that is much more valuable than designing an ideal plan at the start and never looking at it again.\nIn assigning yourself a grade, consider questions like:\n\nHow realistic was your initial plan? If/when you identified unrealistic plans, did you adjust them appropriately?\nHow well did you stick to your plan? Did you complete tasks on time? If you fell behind, did you take steps to get back on track?\nHow effectively did you manage your time? Did you allocate enough time for each task, or did you underestimate the time required?\nDid you meet or exceed the targets you set for yourself? Did you keep sight of your priorities?"

Consider your other commitments and responsibilities when creating your plan.\nPlan for skill snowballing. The skills taught in this class are cumulative, which means that early in the quarter your projects will be simpler, taking relatively little time to tackle but only demonstrating one or two core standards at a time. As the quarter progresses, projects demonstrating more advanced standards will necessarily also demonstrate earlier standards, meaning more time and effort per project, but also ample opportunity to fill in gaps and improve scores on earlier standards. Critically, you will inevitably spend much more time on core standards assignments in the second half of the quarter than the first. If you want to distribute your workload more evenly, consider front-loading enrichment activities, starting your data project early, and/or working ahead with the many resources available to get a head start on a more advanced project. Many projects on the menu require skills covered over several weeks, but you can make progress on them as we go rather than waiting until we’ve covered all the material necessary for 100% of the project.\nWork with others. Share your plan with classmates, form study groups, and check-in on Slack when you’re nervous about falling behind. Accountability to yourself is an important skill to build, but building in accountability to others never hurts."

For example:\n\nCore Standards / Enrichment project:\n\nSubmission: Pet Adoption - Gilroy, Audrey\n\nIntegrative Data Project (multiple attempts):\n\nSubmission: Integrative Data Project (2nd draft) - Dowling, Natalie\n\n\n\nAdd a PR description\nIn the PR description, include your full name, the title of the assignment (it should match what you submit on the form), the contents of the repo, and a brief description of the project (or updates since last submission).\nYou can also add a message to your grader if you like.\nExample:\n## Assignment\n- Name: Natalie Dowling\n- Assignment name: Pet Adoption (control flow)\n- Description: structured control flow exercise\n\n## Contents\n- completed pet-adoption.qmd\n- completed submission.qmd\n- README.md\n- .gitignore\n- output/ folder with a knitted pdf of the main doc and an exported .csv of one of the data frames created in the assignment\n\n## Notes for the grader\nThis is the same structured exercise about control flow as the one in the GH classrooms assignment.\nI built it in its own repo to demonstrate Obj #2.\nThen click Create pull request.\nThis PR is now your official submission space, equivalent to the auto-generated PR from GitHub Classroom."

Instead of grading your work and giving a 0 (after which you could not resubmit), your grader may suggest you start over to make the most of the work you’ve already done.\nYou missed the mark in a tiny, trivial way. Something that was significant enough to where your grader can’t give you the points, but minor enough that it’s clear you could earn the points if you made a very very small correction that you will likely know exactly how to do without any guidance (because that’s how obvious it was that you had a good grasp of the skill!).\n\nYou may use the PR to notify your grader if you believe there was a clear mistake in grading. For example, if the number assigned in on GitHub does not match Canvas, or if you clearly demonstrated a skill at a high level but the skill does not have any comments or score attached at all.\nYou may not use the PR (or any other communication) to request resubmission or argue that you deserve a better grade.

    "text": "Academic integrity has become inextricably linked with artificial intelligence in the classroom, but they are not equivalent. AI tools are not inherently unethical, nor are they inherently ethical. They can be used to cheat, but they can also be used to learn. They can be used to misrepresent, but they can also be used to clarify. They can be used to plagiarize, but they can also be used to create.\nThis policy outlines what will count as cheating in this class and offers suggestions for how to use LLMs constructively. It is not exhaustive, and it is not a substitute for your own judgment. If you are ever unsure whether a particular use of AI is appropriate, ask me.\nStudents in this course are expected to follow UChicago’s Academic Honesty & Plagiarism policy. To add clarity to this general policy, in this class I am using Oxford University’s explanation of plagiarism:\n\nPlagiarism is presenting work or ideas from another source as your own, with or without consent of the original author, by incorporating it into your work without full acknowledgement. All published and unpublished material, whether in manuscript, printed or electronic form, is covered under this definition, as is the use of material generated wholly or in part through use of artificial intelligence (save when use of Artificial Intelligence - AI for assessment has received prior authorisation e.g. as a reasonable adjustment for a student’s disability). Plagiarism can also include re-using your own work without citation.\n\nIn Data to Manuscript in R, you may use AI tools for coding, but not for writing. This means you may use AI to generate and revise code without penalty.\nYou may not submit any AI-generated written work, including but not limited to:\n\nWritten responses to questions in assignments\nNarrative text of your data project\nProject reflections\nAI statements1\n\n“AI-generated written work” includes using AI to generate text that you then revise or edit.\n\nPlagiarized written work, whether from human or AI creators, will receive a non-negotiable 0."

    "text": "Ethical AI Use\nThe relationship between AI and plagiarism is complicated, to put it mildly. ChatGPT doesn’t care if you plagiarize it. Bard’s career isn’t going to suffer if you benefit from its work without giving due credit. Dall-E doesn’t have artistic integrity. It doesn’t matter to AI, but it should matter to you.\nThe work you produce as a student is a representation of you. It not only demonstrates the skills you’ve gained in your education, it is often the only “you” some professors, employers, and peers will know before making important judgments and decisions that directly affect you. If you, for example, apply to a PhD program with a writing sample and personal statement that someone or something else wrote, you will be expected to produce comparable intellectual contributions on the spot at interviews and throughout your career.\nThis kind of misrepresentation cuts both ways. AI seems extraordinarily intelligent and capable, but it is not nearly as smart and capable as you are when it comes to telling the difference between reality and fantasy. You may be prone to human error, less-than-perfect writing, or other academic struggles, but AI is prone to hallucinations. It asserts completely inaccurate things with extreme confidence. When you claim AI’s work as your own, you are taking ownership over any inaccurate, confusing, bizarre, offensive, or otherwise problematic material it has created.\nI believe AI can be used ethically, but I caution you to give serious thought to whether and how you choose to use it, apart from whether and how you are permitted to do so. The ethical complications of AI extend well beyond plagiarism and misrepresentation concerns; any use of large language models will have global consequences. It is your responsibility to weigh the risks and benefits with regard to your personal use, within the bounds of what is explicitly allowed.\nLLMs are actively harming the environment and exploiting workers, in both cases disproportionately so in low-income and already exploited regions. These models perpetuate racist and classist societal bias and misrepresent non-Western cultures. We as users are complicit, whether or not we hold these biases ourselves."

    "text": "Constructive AI Use\nLarge language models aren’t the first technological breakthrough to revolutionize learning. Graphing calculators allow you to tackle more complex problems in calculus. R, Stata, and SPSS allow us to apply statistical analyses and visualize data rapidly and reliably. Spell check and tools like Grammarly2 can make your writing process more efficient. Citations managers like Zotero let you spend more time on reading and analyzing materials and less time poring over style guides.\nBut a graphing calculator won’t do your homework if you don’t know enough calculus to make use of it. RStudio won’t give you anything to work with unless you understand how the programming language works and have a solid grasp on how to select and apply analyses. Spelling and grammar checkers are notorious for making bizarre, decontextualized, and flat out incorrect suggestions that you need to be able to identify and manually fix. Zotero can’t produce a comprehensive and accurate References section if you don’t maintain your database consistently.\nSimilarly, ChatGPT can’t produce quality (or accurate, reliable, or relevant) content if you don’t have the foundational skills to create effective prompts. The most constructive way to use LLM tools will depend on what you the user are bringing to the “conversation.”\nYou shouldn’t use AI to cheat yourself out of an education or set yourself up for failure. Don’t use AI-generated content for anything you couldn’t generate yourself. Instead, use AI to help you learn the material and get to the point where you can do it yourself (and so can make constructive use of AI-generated shortcuts). Use it to break down a dense passage in a reading. Ask it the questions you’d rather not bring up in class.\nYou can find some concrete examples of how to constructively use AI in different contexts in the section Learning Tools vs. Content Generators below."

    "section": "Tips, Tricks, and Strategies",
    "text": "Tips, Tricks, and Strategies\nSo in practice, what exactly are you literally supposed to do?\nFirst and foremost, when an instructor has explicitly stated what uses of AI are and are not allowed in their class, that’s how you should and shouldn’t use AI in that class. Full stop.\nWhen there’s no explicit statement, it’s up to you to rely on your common sense and integrity. This section has some general guidelines and rules of thumb for how to approach this.\n\nSuggested Appropriate and Constructive Uses of AI Writing and Coding Tools\n\nComing up with a title for your paper\nFinding alternative wording for a specific idea you are struggling to articulate\nMaking your writing more concise\nBrainstorming topics and research questions\nCreating a list of important researchers in your topic area to start looking for sources\nProofreading and copy-editing your full drafts\nGenerating base-level code to correct and develop (akin to the kind of responses you’d get on Stack Overflow)\nPerforming a preliminary translation between natural or programming languages with short blocks of text or code\n\nEven in these cases, you should be careful to critically evaluate the output and make sure it is accurate and representative of what you’re intending to communicate. LLMs are particularly bad at making good judgments about what is important to keep and ok to lose when it comes to making your writing more concise. It definitely can help with that, but you have to give it a lot of guidance to keep it focused on cutting unnecessary content only.\n\n\nTreat AI Like a Person\nIt is unethical and plagiaristic to claim the ideas and writing of another entity–including digital entities like ChatGPT–are your own. There is admittedly a fine line between using a phrase or wording suggestion produced by AI and using so much generated text as to constitute plagiarism. To figure out which side of the line you’re on in a given situation, pretend that ChatGPT is a person.\nAsk yourself: If this work was created by a human…\n\nHow would you cite it?\n\nIf you’re using a phrasing suggestion that you might find in any written work, general knowledge facts you asked AI to retrieve, or anything else that you could access in many other ways, that’s probably ok to use.\nIf you would cite the source as a direct (with quotation marks and in-text citation) or indirect (paraphrased and in-text citation) quote, you should account for it. You might directly quote a human source if you are using narrowly defined text or using a large chunk of text. In this case, if you do use the quote you should cite it according to your style guide’s recommendations. See the APA guidelines here. The better option is to figure out where AI got the idea from in the first place, then go read that source and cite it directly.\n\nWould you copy and paste it?\n\nFor written text: If you want to include so much text from an LLM source that you’d copy and paste it into your document, you need to treat it like a direct quote. At that point it’s not just helping you write, it’s doing it for you. If you aren’t quite sure whether it’s too much text to use without citing the AI, type it out yourself rather than copying and pasting. If the idea of typing out that much seems silly, it’s probably inappropriate to use it.\nFor coding/programming: Because programming is, well, programmatic, there’s not a lot of variation between efficient code written by different humans for relatively simple tasks. It’s common and ethical practice to reuse your own old code. It’s also usually ok to copy-paste code from publicly available learning and development resources (e.g., the Cookbook for R) or from crowd-sourced sites (e.g., Stack Overflow). It’s not ok to find someone else’s script on GitHub and present it as your own work without proper citation. Applying these rules to AI, it’s probably ok to ask ChatGPT to write a function for you to do a specific task or a block of code to address a specific issue you’re stuck on. It’s probably not ok to generate a full, complex script without proper citation. It’s definitely not ok to do so for class assignments. (This is a point about ethical use only. There’s more about constructive AI use for programming below.)\n\nWould you trust it?\n\nYou wouldn’t (or at least shouldn’t) take just any human-generated writing as perfectly accurate, unbiased, or fully informed. Before referencing any work, you would (should) check the credentials of the individual and/or publication, fact-check claims on topics you’re not an expert on, and think critically about whether/how these ideas fit into the wider literature and big-picture concepts.\nMaybe this will change in years to come, but right now in 2025 AI-generated writing is typically less accurate, more biased, and less informed compared to human-generated writing. Don’t give it any undue credit or benefit of the doubt!\n\n\n\n\nLearning Tools vs. Content Generators\nAssess your own knowledge and experience in any given context to decide whether AI should be a tool to improve your efficiency (like a calculator, programming language, or citation manager) or a tool to facilitate learning.\n\nWhat do you want?\nUltimately it’s up to you do decide what “constructive” use of AI means to you. It’s up to you to decide whether you even care that you use AI constructively. As you’re figuring it out, reflect on this question: Why are you here and not somewhere else?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy are you here and not somewhere else?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s a UChicago Booth unofficial motto (which may not be the absolute best place to find your personal guiding ethics), but the question is worth asking wherever you find yourself. If you want to use AI to get ahead, great! But what does “getting ahead” actually mean? Why are you putting your valuable time, energy, and money into your education? What do you want out of this experience? How can you use AI to not just arbitrarily “get ahead,” but to move toward the places you personally want to go?\nYou have chosen to dedicate your precious financial, emotional, and cognitive resources to earning your UChicago degree, a piece of paper that is only meaningful if it is symbolic of the knowledge you gained and produced. An unearned degree may (or may not) get you a job, but it will not sustain your success. Reliance on LLMs can make you less creative and lead to decreased long-term neural and cognitive function.\nEven if you view your education as purely transactional, consider that using AI may damage your chances on the job market. When you claim AI’s work as your own, you are taking ownership of its bullshit and risking reputational consequences.\n\n\nI suggest really giving some thought to what “constructive” AI use means to you. Imagine yourself using ChatGPT in different ways in different contexts. Which ones are worth it?"
