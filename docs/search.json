Yuchen, Mian, and I are all grading as quickly as we can, and our goal is to get you feedback as soon as possible so you know what you need to do for the remainder of the quarter. For the most part, the TAs are handling mini-projects, and I am handling the research projects. We grade in the order that we receive submissions, so the earlier you submit, the earlier you’ll get a grade. At this point in the quarter, everyone is submitting many projects and drafts at once, so you should expect a longer turnaround than submissions earlier in the quarter.\nFeedback: On your assessment form, there should be a commented explanation any time you do not receive credit for an attempted objective. In some cases you will get general comments on the submission as a whole, but in the interests of time, we are focusing on the objectives. If you don’t see general feedback at the end of the assessment document, it’s not because we didn’t grade your work holistically and thoroughly. It’s simply that we must be pragmatic with our time to get everyone feedback quickly.\nResearch project assessment document: The final research project has its own assessment document: research-assessment.md. You can find this file in the top level of your assessment repository. Copy and paste the document into your project’s repo and complete in full. Please use the most up-to-date version of this document.\n\nChanges to this document from the version posted at the beginning of the quarter:\n\nMore detailed overall expectations for the project (structure, content, etc.)\nAI statement & optional AI use reflection\nClarifications of expectations for some objectives\nRelaxed (easier to meet) expectations for some objectives\nOptional project reflection section\nGrading summary section\n\nIf you submitted a draft on or before Sunday, February 23rd using an older version of the assessment, I have updated it for you.\nIf you submit a draft on or after Monday, February 24th, you must use the most up-to-date version of the assessment document. Submissions using the older version will be asked to resubmit with the correct document. Since I won’t notice the older assessment until I get to your draft in my grading queue, this may delay returning your graded work to you.\nWhen you submit a second (or later) draft of your research project, you should simply update the document that already has your previous feedback. Do not create a new assessment document and do not remove grader comments from the previous draft.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter class: Preview and set up bibtex\n\n\n\n\nTo-do:\n\nPreview the remainder of the slides for dynamic text (bibtex citations)\nFollow the guide to setup a Zotero-citr workflow\n\nTime-permitting, we’ll do this together in class on Friday. It’s not terribly complicated though, so you can get a jump start on it to make early progress on the BibTeX requirements for your project.\n\n\nRecommended exercises:\n\nNo new mini-projects\nMini-projects that are good opportunities to practice dynamic text references:\n\n05_data-communication/01_transpose-to-quarto\n05_data-communication/02_simple-qmd\n05_data-communication/03_class-topic-demo\n08_unassessed-misc/07_tutorial"

If you are considering this option, reach out to Dr. Dowling as soon as possible.\n\nOffice hours:\n\nDr. Dowling will hold extra office hours over Zoom during Week 9 and finals week. Sign up here.\n\nPlease do not sign up for more than 1 appointment!\n\nIf you would like to attend multiple, you can attend in pairs or groups (ie each individual student signs up for 1 appointment but everyone attends all of them together).\n\nMeetings on Wednesday March 5th and Friday March 7th may take place either over Zoom or in person in my office. We’ll assume Zoom by default, but send me an email if you book one of those times and prefer to meet in person.\nUnfortunately I do not have availability outside these extra time slots, but you are free to reach out to me or the TAs over email. And as always, post to Slack!\n\nMian and Yuchen may hold additional office hours. We will keep you updated with Slack announcements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter class: Live your best life with data and manuscripts\n\n\n\n\nWe’re done!\n\nSubmit your final draft by next Wednesday. Whatever you’ve submitted by 11:59pm on Wednesday will become your final grade for the project.\nBe on the lookout for a survey from me about the class and improvements for future quarters.\nSubmit a community engagement reflection if you like.\nPlease keep in touch with me and with each other!

If I’m right, I want to fix this as soon as possible since we’re nearing the end of the quarter. The 2 biggest things I want to communicate in this long message are:\n\nTalk to me if you need help.\nDon’t let flexibility be a distraction.\n\nNot sure how many projects to do? Which projects to do? What counts as assessed and unassessed and off the menu and off the syllabus or any of the other terms I’m throwing around? Please ask me.This is the first time using an alternative grading system in this class, and it’s important to me that it is a better experience for you than the old system. Clearly not everything is going 100% smoothly, and I’m learning as we go what parts of the course design need fixing. That’s all well and good for future students who will benefit from changes made going forward, but I have a responsibility to make sure the less-than-helpful parts of the system aren’t holding you back right now.If you are feeling unsure about how to get the grade you want, please email me. We can work out a plan to give you more structure and guidance to get you where you want to go. You don’t have to just flail and guess and hope for the best.In addition to encouraging you to ask for help with your specific circumstances, here are some general bits of advice:\n\nAgain, don’t let flexibility be a distraction. If you’re looking at this vast “menu” and all the many times I say “do whatever!” on the website and it’s making you feel like you don’t know where to start, tune it out. Pick the mini-projects you’re going to do now from the ones already published, ignore the optional/challenge parts, and set yourself deadlines for submission (you can ask me or the TAs to help you set goals).\nYou only have to meet 20 unique objectives across all mini-projects. Pick which 20 you want those to be and work toward them. Frustrated by git and/or apaquarto and dreading the idea of making a new repo for those purposes? Don’t include those objectives in your 20.\n\nI expect most students will need to complete 3-5 mini-projects to earn 50 points. If you’re not sure how many you should try, budget time for 6-7.\nTo help you plan, I’ve put together a list of all published mini-projects along with the essential info about each. View that list here.\nIf you’re unsure how to earn a point for some particular objective, look at the recommendations in the assessment file and follow them to the letter. In some cases that will mean forcing in some arbitrary elements just to prove you can.\n\nFor the other 20 points, there’s a good chance that in the work you’re already doing you are checking off some of the “unassessed” objectives. Adding lots of comments? Using internally consistent style? Planning out your plots with the grammar of graphics? Transforming your data into a tidy format because you can identify that it needs to be tidy for plotting? These are all points. When you complete the assessment for a project, look at that list carefully and see if there are any points you already did without even thinking about it and/or if there are some you could hit with minimal additional effort.\nYou do not need to push yourself to complete projects to exceptional standards. Remember: Done is better than good. If you have to choose between getting something done and making something “good,” choose done. In this system you are cumulatively earning points, not losing points for imperfections. There’s no reason not to turn in “bad” work if it’s going to get you to your ultimate goal.\nIf the “off-the-menu” and “off-the-syllabus” project ideas are confusing, just ignore them. You don’t need either. These are there for people who are already motivated to pursue them for their own interests, not to distract anyone from focusing on the basics.\n\nI genuinely want every person in this class to earn an A, and from what I’ve seen so far I think you all can. Again, it’s my responsibility to make sure this new class structure is not so chaotic that it harms your learning or your grades, but I can’t help you if you don’t let me know there’s a problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter class: Get organized! And test hypotheses\n\n\n\n\nTo-do: Make/review you plan\n\nIt’s the end of 7th week — how close are you to the 50 mini-project points? The 40 research project points? What do you need to do to get the grade you want by the end of the quarter?\nDeadlines:\n\nMini-projects due March 5th (Wed Week 9)\nFinal research projects due March 12th (Wed Finals Week)\n\n\nRecommended exercise:\n\nInferential statistics structured exercise:\n\nPractice using R to analyze data with common inferential statistics techniques. The exercise includes some work with ggplot2 and opportunities to use inline R code in narrative statistical interpretation.\nAssociated files: 04_data-analysis/02_hypothesis-testing"

Remember that you’ll need to include both for full points. We’ll cover how to implement common hypothesis testing/inferential statistics on Friday (e.g., ANOVA, chi2, linear regression, glm), and you’ll want to be ready to try them out with your data during class. If you know you’ll need to include a specific kind of analysis that’s not one of the “basics,” drop a message in the #help-stats-and-analysis channel with info about what you’ll be using and I may add it to the materials for Friday if it’s something I think others would benefit from covering too.\nRecommended exercise:\n\nDescriptive statistics structured exercise:\n\nPractice using R to calculate and interpret descriptive statistics. Unlike in previous assignments, you will not use a built-in dataset. Instead, you will use data from a published, open-access dataset capturing relationships between math anxiety and self-perception. The exercise includes simple tasks with tables and ggplot.\nAssociated files: 04_data-analysis/01_descriptive"

Excuse me, do you have a moment to talk about version control? PeerJ Preprints\n.gitignore Documentation\n\n\n*Required reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClass meeting: GitHub & R Essentials\n\n\n\n\nMaterials:\n\nSlides (v2 1/13/25 4:30pm)\nProgrammer’s groceries demo (this is in the d2mr-assessment repo, so make sure you can pull from upstream!)\n\nClass plans:\n\nLecture: GitHub & R Essentials\n\nNote: This is a long, dense lecture that we probably won’t make it all the way through, so be sure to review the slides and read the required readings before class!\n\nActivities:\n\nProbably none\nIf by some chance we get through the whole lecture with time to spare we’ll work on some simple programming exercises\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfo: Office hours, copilot, assessment repo, exercises\n\n\n\n\nAnnouncements:\n\nOffice hours: For the time being I need to limit my office hours to a maximum of 2 appointments per quarter. I am hopeful that at some point in February I will be able to add more hours each week so that I don’t have to have a per-quarter cap. I’ll keep you posted if that’s the case!\n\nReminders:\n\nCopilot: Using copilot in RStudio (or any AI/LLM) is fully optional for this course.\n\nI do recommend setting it up and trying it out, but you are not required to do so, and it’s not worth driving yourself up a wall for. You do not need Copilot for any material on the syllabus, and it does not have to be part of your troubleshooting/debugging workflow. The integrated Copilot in RStudio isn’t designed for debugging anyway, since it’s essentially a fancy autocomplete and not something you can prompt with questions.\nThe one thing I’ll add here is a link to RStudio’s documentation for using Copilot. If you’re just getting started that’s the place to go first. (Also, if you started there but have since hit issues and tried a bunch of other things, it never hurts to just download a fresh copy of RStudio and start from scratch! The “have you tried turning it off and on again” approach solves more problems that you might expect.)\nPlease continue to ask for help setting it up on Slack, but know that we will not cover this in class.\n\nAssessment repo: Be sure to pull from the assessments repo frequently. This is where I will add/update both mini-project guidelines and materials for in-class demos.\nExercises: The slides for most lectures include at least 1 suggested exercise related to the lecture’s topic. These vary in scope and complexity. They are not required and there is nothing to submit.\n\nAll exercises include a box on the slide listing the numbers of the assessed and unassessed learning objectives I intend for the exercise to primarily address. This is just for your reference, so you can decide what to prioritize and you can get a sense of what kind of things demonstrate each objective. You can see which numbers go with which objectives either by rendering the assessment.md file or by referring to the website.\nSome exercises additionally reference an associated mini-project, which are usually additional guidelines to complete a moderately more complex version of the exercise. For exercises that do not have an associated mini-project, you are welcome to expland the exercise into a full mini-project. Follow the “off-the-menu” instructions to do so.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter class: Programmer’s groceries & recommended exercises\n\n\n\n\nTo-do:\n\nProgrammer’s groceries demo\n\nThe groceries.qmd notebook walks through examples of writing conditionals and defining functions based on a very old and cliche joke. The notebook includes both extensive markdown explanation and code in chunks you can run individually.\nStart by working through the notebook and executing the code, then experiment a little with the code to see if you can make things more efficient or introduce new scenarios.\n\nNext class on R Markdown & Quarto will be another dense lecture, so be sure to review the slides and read the required readings and preview the slides before class. Slides will be posted by Wednesday.\n\nRecommended exercises: View slides for additional details for each exercise.\n\nGitHub required files:\n\nRevisit the README.md and .gitignore files you created in the W1C2 exercises. With your new knowledge of the whats and whys of GitHub and these files, revise the README to make it more informative and revise the .gitignore to include any files or folders that fall into the categories we discussed in class.\n\nSimple .R script:\n\nWrite a simple .R script that (minimally) loads the tidyverse packages, requires a package, includes commented text, and assigns at least one numberic and one string variable. To go further, use vectors to create a data frame or tibble and/or source() your R script into a code chunk in an R Markdown document.\n\nhello_world() function:\n\nDefine a hello_world() function in an .R script that includes object assignment, conditional logic, and (ideally) a for or while loop. The function should take at least one argument and return at least two possible values.\nAssociated mini-project: 06_r-programming/01_hello-world\n\nSkeleton repo:\n\nCreate a GitHub repo connected to an R project for either a planned or fictional research project. In the R Project, create a “skeleton” that includes all the files and folders you anticipate needing for the project. Structure your repo to exclude all files and directories that should (for whatever reason) be excluded. As you work, use git best practices for version control, including frequent informative commit messages and functional, up-to-date README and .gitignore files.\nAssociated mini-project: 07_git-github/01_skeleton-repo"

Optionally, clone the repo to play around with the files. You can set up a relationship to the upstream repo to pull in changes if you want, but it’s not necessary if you don’t want the git headache.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClass meeting: “Pretty” plots\n\n\n\n\nMaterials:\n\nSlides (v1 2/20/25 @11am)\nData viz walkthrough part 2 (03_data-viz/00_viz-walkthrough-2)\nExample apaquarto manuscript (d2mr-apaquarto repo)\n\nClass plans:\n\nLecture: Pretty plots\nSmall groups: .qmd figures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfo: Notes on grading\n\n\n\n\nGrading notes\n\nMeeting objectives: To make sure you get credit for the objectives you attempt to demonstrate, read through the assessment doc before submission to see if you’ve done the suggested tasks for each. For example:\n\n(5) Find, install, require, and load R packages: Did you use more than one function?\n(6) Use arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators: Did you use all 3 types?\n(8) Parse and write conditional statements and/or loops: Do your conditionals use more than one function in more than one context?\n(9) Use readr functions to read in and write out data: Will your script read in data for your grader (use relative paths!)?\n(22) Create and effectively use code chunks following best practices: Do all your chunks have unique and informative labels?\n(26) Create and maintain a quarto document YAML header: Does your header include options for an APA styled document?\nYou can still get credit for an objective without exactly matching the recommended tasks, but you’ll need to show effort and capability that is essentially the equivalent. If you believe you’ve done so, make a note of how you’ve shown comparable skills in your assessment document.\n\nObjective categories: When you’re attempting objectives, be conscious of the category each is under. Keep the broader context in mind. For example:\n\nGit and GitHub: These objectives should show your abilities to create and maintain projects using git. Working in a git repository that you didn’t make or editing a readme file that you didn’t create doesn’t showcase your skills (it showcases mine). Effectively using version control doesn’t just mean you pushed to github, it means you’re using the git and github systems as an effective replacement for not using the git systems.\nNotebooks and code chunks: These objectives should demonstrate your ability to effectively use markdown notebooks to execute skills demonstrated elsewhere. Maybe you made beautiful ggplots that met all plotting objectives, but to get (24) you need to integrate those figures into a notebook, including referencing it in the text. It’s not about the plotting skills; it’s about the markdown and notebook skills.\nR Markdown and Quarto: These objectives should show your ability to create and maintain publication quality documents — the manuscript part of “Data to Manuscript.” Like with Git/GitHub, you’ll need to show your abilities to create and maintain (not mine), and you’ll need to show how the skills work in a publication-styled document. For example, to show “(27) Use quarto R Markdown to compose an academic manuscript,” it’s not enough to just use bold formatting and create lists; you need to show the markdown formatting in an academic manuscript.\n\nAsk us! If you’re feeling uncertain about what “counts” or you don’t understand your grades, ask Dr. Dowling and your TA for help understanding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter class: Secure data; level 2 data viz exercises\n\n\n\n\nTasks:\n\nUsing public data? Download everything you need locally. The politics of research right now is unpredictable and horrifying. Control what little you can by creating a local version of data or any other materials needed for your work.\n\nRecommended exercises:\n\nData visualization walkthrough (part 2)\n\nContinuation of the ggplot demo. Part 2 covers more advanced skills, including the scales, facets, and theme layers.\nAssociated files: 03_data-viz/00_data-viz-walkthrough-2\n\nCreate a ggplot2 theme\n\nCreate a custom ggplot2 theme that reflects your personal visualization style while maintaining clarity and professionalism (or not). Your theme should be reusable across different types of plots and demonstrate understanding of ggplot2’s theming system, including effective uses of the theme() layer and (optionally) non-data-dependent visual elements created as arguments of non-theme layers.\nAssociated mini-project: 03_data-viz/03_ggplot-theme\n\n(OTS) Non-ggplot figures\n\nCreate a data visualization project that demonstrates your ability to create publication-quality plots using R packages other than ggplot2. You may use alternatives to ggplot2 or extensions.\nAssociated mini-project: 03_data-viz/06_ots-non-ggplot"

You will still have questions, and you will still get answers! But they will be asked and answered on Slack only.\nI will make announcements on Slack in the dedicated #announcements channel. You are responsible for all the information communicated this way, even if I never bring it up in class. Be sure you have notifications turned on for Slack. At a minimum, you should get a notification when someone tags you or @everyone, when someone directly replies to a thread you’re in, and when someone posts in the #announcements channel.\nThere is/was an out of date version of the assessment doc in the cleaning-level-1 mini-project. Please read the announcement in the Slack channel for more info and what to do if you have completed or intend to complete that project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter class: Prepare for workshop, (5!) wrangling exercises\n\n\n\n\nTo-do: Prepare for Friday’s workshop\nNote: The “conceptualize your dataset” exercise is designed to set you up for the workshop. I strongly recommend completing that exercise before Friday and spending your class time working on the to-do/to-learn list you generate, but you’re free to work on other projects if you prefer.\n\nSelect something to work on for the data preparation workshop on Friday. This can be a mini-project that involves cleaning and wrangling (not necessarily from the cleaning/wrangling categories) or part of the data prep needed for your final research project.\nCreate a to-do list for what you’d like to accomplish in the 80 minute workshop. Note which parts you can do on your own and which parts you’d like help with. You’ll have Dr. Dowling, your section TA, and your classmates to collaborate with; the more specific you can be identifying what you need help with ahead of time the more efficiently you’ll be able to get that help.\n\nRecommended exercises: View slides and mini-project repo files for additional details for each exercise.\n\nConceptualize your dataset:\n\nConceptualize the dataset you’ll need to create for your final research project. Imagine what kinds of figures you’d like to create or analyses you’d like to run. What variables and observations would you need for each? Articulate your research questions and hypotheses and see how they can map onto your dataset’s structure.\nCreate a tabular mockup of your goal dataset(s) using Excel, pencil and paper, or any non-programmy thing you like. Don’t worry about whether you know how to get there yet. Focus on structure, not code.\nIn your final research project repo, create an .R script called data-prep.R (or similar). Use comments to write out in plain English the steps you’ll need to take to turn your current dataset into your goal dataset.\nIdentify parts of the comments you can fill in now with R code you already know. Create a to-learn list for parts that you’ll need to learn new functions or techniques.\n\nData wrangling structured exercises:\n\nWalkthrough: Clean the iris Dataset\n\nWalkthrough doesn’t actually exist. At least not right now. Between the cleaning walkthrough, the cleaning projects, the in-class demos, and the highly structured format, you should be able to approach Level1 wrangling on your own. I may add one later if I see there is a need for it.\n\nLevel 1: Recreate a starwars Dataset\n\nWork with a medium-sized dataset (starwars) and transform to match a goal dataset. Most tasks are outlined in the assignment script.\nAssociated mini-project: 02_data-wrangling/01_recreate-level-1\n\nLevel 2: Recreate a gapminder Dataset\n\nWork with a more complex dataset and perform more involved wrangling and transformation tasks. General guidance is given without much structured support.\nAssociated mini-project: 02_data-wrangling/02_recreate-level-2\n\n\nWrangling group make-a-mess:\n\nWork together with a classmate to each dramatically transform/wrangle a dataset for the other(s) to recreate. Each partner will choose a publicly available dataset and transform it using tidyverse functions. You will then swap transformed datasets with your partner and attempt to recreate their work.\nAssociated mini-project: 02_data-wrangling/03_group-make-a-mess\n\nCreate a data wrangling function:\n\nDefine a function to execute procedural data wrangling tasks. Your final product should be an .R script that defines your function, then runs your function in a variety of test cases\n“Wrangling” is loosely defined here. It should be a function that serves a useful and plausible purpose for data preparation.\nNote: You may use your final research project data to guide the development of your function in this mini-project, but code you submit for this mini-project will not also count toward demonstrating objectives on your final project.\nAssociated mini-project: 06_r-programming/03_wrangling-function\n\nRecreate an existing function:\n\nRecreate one or more existing functions from base R or a package of your choice. Your final product should be an .R script that defines your function, then compares the output with that of the original function.\nThe goal is not to literally recreate the actual function, but to define a function that conceptually matches the function and achieves a similar result.\nNote: This may sound intimidating, but it really is an any-level project. You can work towards a fully equivalent function that does produces exactly the same outpu in all cases, or you can take a function and just break it down fully conceptually without writing any code at all. Or (I expect in most cases) anywhere in between.\nAssociated mini-project: 06_r-programming/04_recreate-function"

(You’ll never mark “objective met”, which is for graders.)\n\nAdditional information:\n\nThe no-deadlines-do-what-you-want assessment style of this class is supposed to make it easier, not harder, to learn. If you’re feeling overwhelmed, please let us know so we can help you get back on track! I suggest coming up with a loose timeline for when you’d like to submit mini-projects and research project drafts throughout the quarter, anticipating changes as we go.\nRecommendations to get you started:\n\nSubmit your first mini-project by the end of Week 3, and plan on 1 every 2 weeks after that\nSubmit a first (very incomplete!) draft of your research project by the end of Week 4, then additional drafts every 2-3 weeks as needed\n\nYour “draft” can be very, very simple. By the end of Week 4, you should be able to confidently demonstrate some skills across multiple categories – GitHub, R programming, markdown, and tidyverse, at least! You do not (and probably should not) wait to submit your first draft until it has all the components you want in the final project. Treat this as iterative and cumulative work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter class: Check on repo collaborator invites\n\n\n\n\nTo-do:\n\nDouble check that (1) you invited Dr. Dowling and your section’s TA to your repo(s) and (2) they accepted the invitation. If we didn’t accept, the invite link may have expired and you’ll need to re-invite us.\n\nRecommended exercises: View slides for additional details for each exercise.\n\nCreate apaquarto repos: Create directories for 3 (temporary) apaquarto projects using each of the 3 setup methods. Connect each to a (temporary) github repository. Play around to find where there is flexibility and where things can break.\nSimple .qmd notebook: Create a new quarto notebook (.qmd), and follow all best practices for notebooks and code chunks as you work. Add a YAML header, at least 1 setup code chunk, at least 1 non-setup code chunk, and narrative text formatted with markdown.\n\nAssociated mini-project: 05_data-communication/02_simple-qmd"

The “from Data to Viz” link above can be a good starting point.\nTake a look at the new mini-projects that have been posted this week (there are a lot!). In addition to projects about data visualization, there are instructions for most MPs in the “miscellaneous” category and a handful of others in other categories. If you see a project that is interesting to you but see that you don’t know everything you would need to complete 100% of the project, remember it’s totally ok to simplify the projects or focus just on the skills do you know instead of waiting until you’ve got everything mastered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClass meeting: Data visualization Workshop\n\n\n\n\nClass plans:\n\nActivities: (no lecture)\n\n(if needed) 15 minutes support for github clone setup\nLarge group visualization workshop\nSmall group visualization collaboration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfo: Engagement grades\n\n\n\n\nReminders:\n\nMid-quarter engagement grades: Provisional community engagement grades are posted Friday Week 5. This is to give you a sense of what you can expect your final engagement grade to be if you continue participating in class at the same level you have been so far. Remember:\n\nGrades are assigned by Dr. Dowling, with input from TAs about how they have seen students engage that Dr. Dowling may not see\nThese grades will be fully replaced at the end of the quarter, and no matter what your grade is now there is the potential to gain all 10 points by the end of the quarter.\nThe easiest way to bump up your grade is by participating more on Slack. You can see more suggestions for how to raise this component of your grade here.\nFeel like your grade doesn’t accurately reflect your engagement thus far? Two possibilities:\n\nYou could be wrong. Not that you’re not trying, but that you may be overestimating your engagement relative to the course expectations. Take a minute to reflect a bit on your participation thus far, read over the suggestions for ways to engage, and consider that this grade starts at 0, not 10 (you earn points; you don’t lose them).\nYou could be right! If you think you’re engaging in ways that Dr. Dowling and the TAs haven’t noticed, you can let us know! The “Community Engagement” assignment on Canvas (where you see the provisional grade) has an optional submission component. You can use this submission as a way to show/tell us how you’ve been an active part of the class community in ways we aren’t aware of. You can submit and resubmit to this assignment as many times as you like over the rest of the quarter, but you won’t receive a re-evaluated numeric grade until the end of the quarter.\n\nAside from giving us more information about your own engagement, please use the assignment submission to let us know how you have seen your classmates positively engage with the community! Someone start a study group? Help you debug your code for 2 hours on a Sunday night out of the goodness of their heart? Give you particularly useful insight during a class workshop? Use this as a place to give them a shout out so they can get the points they deserve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter class: More ggplot; make a timeline; additional MPs\n\n\n\n\nTo-do: Make a submission plan & timeline\nYou’re (more than) half way through the quarter — how far along are you toward earning the 50 mini-project points and 40 research project points? Given that projects allow you to show cumulatively built skills, it’s reasonable to expect that it will be easier to earn more points in the second half of the quarter once you’ve got a lot of the basics under your belt.\nTake a few minutes to make plan for how you’re going to earn the points you need for the grade you want. Are the mini-projects overwhelming? Maybe you want to turn in a lot of small projects instead of a couple big ones. Are they boring? Design your own! Confused by the grading? The sooner you turn in projects, the sooner you get a sense of how grading works, and the more time you leave yourself to earn all the points you want.\nSame goes for the final research project. You’ve got 4 tries to earn the full 40 points, and you do not have to aim to meet all 40 at once. In fact, I strongly suggest you do not wait until you’re at a point where you can reasonably get everything at once. By that point we’ll be very late in the quarter, and you probably won’t have time to submit more than one try.\nRecommended exercises:\n\nData visualization exercises:\n\nData visualization Level 1 and Level 2 mini-projects (posted after last class)\n\nAssociated mini-project: 03_data-viz/01_viz-level-1\nAssociated mini-project: 03_data-viz/02_viz-level-2\n\nGroup/pairs swap plots\n\nWork with a partner to create and recreate data visualizations using ggplot2.

I know this is coming at a bad time and will be very frustrating for some people. I’m here to help! Please post issues in the Slack so we can resolve things quickly.\nWhat do I do with my fork? No matter what, create a local backup first. I suggest deleting your fork when you are confident the new clone system is set up and working correctly. That will help avoid confusion (on your end and mine) about which repo is the “real” one, it will prevent accidental pull requests to the main repo, and it will ensure you’re the only one with full control over your work.\nI’m working on a mini-project now in my fork, what do I do? If you clone your forked repo, all your ongoing work will be in the new repo. Double check that the cloned files are up to date, then continue working in the clone and abandon the work in your fork.\nWhat if I already submitted mini-projects with my fork? Not a problem. You have two options: 1) Leave your fork up for now until your projects have been graded (and finalized by Dr. Dowling). When your grade is finalized, copy the graded assessment.md file into your new clone so that you have a record of your progress in your in-use repo. 2) Resubmit your mini-project to Canvas with a link to the directory in your new clone repo. In either case, once there are no outstanding submitted Canvas assignments with links to your fork, I recommend deleting your fork.\n\nFriday’s workshop: Friday’s class will be a data visualization workshop. Unlike the Week 4 workshop, this won’t be a “free work” period. You should come prepared to discuss your needs and goals for visualizing data for your final research project. We’ll work as a class to concetpualize what your plots should look like and prepare to make them in ggplot.\n\nIf needed, we will devote about 15 minutes to resolving issues with the GitHub change, but we have to limit that time. Please use Slack and your troubleshooting resources to resolve as many issues as possible before Friday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter class: Fix your repo, start data viz projects\n\n\n\n\nTo-do:\n\nDownload the ggplot2 cheatsheet\nMigrate from the github forked assessment repo to a new cloned repo, following the directions in this guide and getting support on Slack if needed\nPrepare for Friday’s workshop by picking 2 tentative plans to visualize data for your final research project. Be ready to share in small groups and as a whole class!\n\nRecommended exercises:\n\nData visualization structured exercises:\n\nWalkthrough: Introduction to data visualizaton with ggplot2 (pt1)\n\nDemo only! This is the demo the lectures follow along with. Part 2 will be added next week.\nAssociated mini-project: 03_data-viz/00_viz-walkthrough\n\nLevel 1: Visualize the mtcars Dataset\n\nWork with a simple dataset to recreate 3 basic plots (using only data, aes, and geoms) and 3 intermediate plots that add other commonly used elements.\nAssociated mini-project: 03_data-viz/01_viz-level-1\n\nLevel 2: Visualize the starwars Dataset\n\nWork with a more complex dataset to recreate 1 advanced (and hideous) plot using many layers and theme elements.\nAssociated mini-project: 03_data-viz/02_viz-level-2"

Top priority!! Attend TA office hours if you’re still having trouble.\n\nAdditional information:\n\nMini-projects should be fully distinct from your final project\n\nIf you want to use the same data in a very different way ask for an exception via the mini-project proposal process\nEven for exceptions, your MP should not be contained within your final project repo\n\nIn most cases, demonstrating the GitHub skills via a mini-project will require creating a new repo for the purposes of the project\nMPs should have a “home” in your assessment repo that contains (minimally) the assessment file\nExpect your MP grades to be lower earlier on, as the quarter goes on you’ll be able to show more and more skills within a single project\nFinal project repo names – make them informative!! This is part of git best practices.\n\n“early-childhood-shrugs” not “final-project-d2mr”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter class: Practice with readr and dplyr\n\n\n\n\nTo-do: Download and store the tidyverse cheatsheets\nRecommended exercises: View slides and mini-project repo files for additional details for each exercise.\n\nRead/write practice:\n\nIn a new notebook, use readr and related functions to read in a tabular dataset (.csv/.tsv), transform the data in some way, then write to a new .csv file. Replicate the process in an .R script, then source that script in the notebook.\nFind or create a variety of datasets to repeat the process, like different file types (e.g., .csv, google sheets, .xlsx, .sav), different “extras” (e.g, multiple tabs, rich formatting, non-data text, header rows), and different combinations of file locations (e.g., notebook and script in same folder folder, one in root folder and one in a subdirectory, writing/reading files in a lower- or higher-level subdirectory).\nPay attention to which packages are necessary to run which functions, which functions include which arguments (and the default argument values, and which differences in relative paths depending on function and file locations.\n\nData cleaning structured exercises:\n\nWalkthrough: Clean the iris Dataset\n\nDemo only! Walks you step by step through a cleaning process, setting you up to complete the Level 1 or 2 mini-projects.\nAssociated mini-project: 01_data-cleaning/00_cleaning-walkthrough\n\nLevel 1: Clean the mtcars Dataset\n\nWork with a simple dataset, focusing on basic data cleaning tasks.

Work on finishing mini-projects and making progress on your final research project. We’ll be workshopping for some of class on Monday and all of class on Friday, so plan ahead for what you want to focus on while you’ve got people around to help.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClass meeting: The D2MR Workflow\n\n\n\n\nMaterials:\n\nSlides (v1 3/2/25 2:00pm)\n\nClass plans:\n\nLecture: Putting it all together - the D2MR workflow\nWorkshop (any remaining time): Collaborative work time for mini-projects and final projects\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfo: Deadlines, grades, engagement, office hours\n\n\n\n\nDeadlines:\n\nMini-projects are due this Wednesday, March 5th at 11:59pm\nFinal drafts of research projects are due next Wednesday, March 12th at 11:59pm\n\nNo extensions\nSyllabus is designed to allow students who need extended deadlines to pace their work throughout the quarter without having to make special requests\n\nFriday is the latest day to negotiate a pass/fail plan (but you should do this sooner rather than later!). If you are considering this option, reach out to Dr. Dowling as soon as possible.\n\nGrades:\n\nEmail me this week (ASAP!) to negotiate a pass/fail option\nGrading scale (point to letter grade conversion)\n\nCommunity engagement:\n\nFinal engagement grades will replace the mid-quarter grades\nThe Canvas assignment where you see the mid-quarter grade is actually a real assignment\n\nYou may (optionally) submit something to that assignment describing how you’ve been engaged in the class in ways I may not have seen\nYou may also use this to give credit to classmates who have been supportive\n\nReminder: Engagement grades are not attendance grades or easy points. You earn up to 10 by doing more than the minimum.\n\nOffice hours:\n\nDr. Dowling will hold extra office hours over Zoom during Week 9 and finals week. Sign up here.\n\nPlease do not sign up for more than 1 appointment!\n\nIf you would like to attend multiple, you can attend in pairs or groups (ie each individual student signs up for 1 appointment but everyone attends all of them together).\n\nMeetings on Wednesday March 5th and Friday March 7th may take place either over Zoom or in person in my office. We’ll assume Zoom by default, but send me an email if you book one of those times and prefer to meet in person.\nUnfortunately I do not have availability outside these extra time slots, but you are free to reach out to me or the TAs over email. And as always, post to Slack!\n\nMian and Yuchen may hold additional office hours. We will keep you updated with Slack announcements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter class: Keep working on your projects!\n\n\n\n\nMini-project tips:\n\nPanicking? There’s a good chance you’re overthinking things.\n\nFigure out what the bare minimum is that you would need to do to get the points you need for a project, and just do that.\nStill have time for a little more? Great, put in a little more to count toward you engagement score.\nDidn’t get everything done? Kind of a bummer, but whatever. Turn in what you have!\n\nRealizing you were overambitious?\n\nCut your losses and swap to an easier and/or more structured project. No judgment.\n\nActually some judgment, but in a good way. I will judge you positively for making a reasoned decision about priorities and organization.\n\n\nReview the graded assessment files for past MPs.\n\nIn some cases the TAs may have indicated you can revise and resubmit, in which case you should do that!\n\nIf they didn’t note it on your assessment, you can ask your TA if they will accept a resubmission, but it is entirely at their discretion. Remember the general policy is no MP resubmissions allowed — this is a kindness from the TAs!\n\nNote where and why you missed attempted objectives. In many cases it is for very tiny things that are very easily fixable in the next project you complete.\n\n\nFinal project tips:\n\nRead the research-assessment.md document closely before you go to complete it for submission!!\n\nIncludes a thorough description of the overall expectations. Failing to meeting these will be reflected in your engagement score.\nIncludes detailed explanations for meeting each objective. Read these closely! There are many that are very easy to meet and very easy to miss\n\nI may give credit for work that does not meet all the outlined expectations for an objective if I believe it has demonstrated mastery of the objective in another way\nYou are required to complete the AI statement. Failure to do so will result in a 5 point penalty.\nUse the most recent version of the assessment document! If you don’t see a detailed list of overall expectations, a section for your AI statement, a reflection section, or a grading section, you’ve got the wrong version!\n\nAside from just missing these sections, you’re missing important clarifications and simplifications for objective expectations."

Practice using the problem-solving strategies from today’s class to figure out 1) what these things are, 2) why they’re important, and 3) how to create them. Keep best practices in mind as you do this, especially regarding comments and transparency.\nSet up Copilot in RStudio and experiment a little. What do you think? How could it be useful to you?

Excuse me, do you have a moment to talk about version control? PeerJ Preprints\n.gitignore Documentation\n\n\n*Required reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClass meeting: GitHub & R Essentials\n\n\n\n\nMaterials:\n\nSlides (v2 1/13/25 4:30pm)\nProgrammer’s groceries demo (this is in the d2mr-assessment repo, so make sure you can pull from upstream!)\n\nClass plans:\n\nLecture: GitHub & R Essentials\n\nNote: This is a long, dense lecture that we probably won’t make it all the way through, so be sure to review the slides and read the required readings before class!\n\nActivities:\n\nProbably none\nIf by some chance we get through the whole lecture with time to spare we’ll work on some simple programming exercises\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfo: Office hours, copilot, assessment repo, exercises\n\n\n\n\nAnnouncements:\n\nOffice hours: For the time being I need to limit my office hours to a maximum of 2 appointments per quarter. I am hopeful that at some point in February I will be able to add more hours each week so that I don’t have to have a per-quarter cap. I’ll keep you posted if that’s the case!\n\nReminders:\n\nCopilot: Using copilot in RStudio (or any AI/LLM) is fully optional for this course.\n\nI do recommend setting it up and trying it out, but you are not required to do so, and it’s not worth driving yourself up a wall for. You do not need Copilot for any material on the syllabus, and it does not have to be part of your troubleshooting/debugging workflow. The integrated Copilot in RStudio isn’t designed for debugging anyway, since it’s essentially a fancy autocomplete and not something you can prompt with questions.\nThe one thing I’ll add here is a link to RStudio’s documentation for using Copilot. If you’re just getting started that’s the place to go first. (Also, if you started there but have since hit issues and tried a bunch of other things, it never hurts to just download a fresh copy of RStudio and start from scratch! The “have you tried turning it off and on again” approach solves more problems that you might expect.)\nPlease continue to ask for help setting it up on Slack, but know that we will not cover this in class.\n\nAssessment repo: Be sure to pull from the assessments repo frequently. This is where I will add/update both mini-project guidelines and materials for in-class demos.\nExercises: The slides for most lectures include at least 1 suggested exercise related to the lecture’s topic. These vary in scope and complexity. They are not required and there is nothing to submit.\n\nAll exercises include a box on the slide listing the numbers of the assessed and unassessed learning objectives I intend for the exercise to primarily address. This is just for your reference, so you can decide what to prioritize and you can get a sense of what kind of things demonstrate each objective. You can see which numbers go with which objectives either by rendering the assessment.md file or by referring to the website.\nSome exercises additionally reference an associated mini-project, which are usually additional guidelines to complete a moderately more complex version of the exercise. For exercises that do not have an associated mini-project, you are welcome to expland the exercise into a full mini-project. Follow the “off-the-menu” instructions to do so.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter class: Programmer’s groceries & recommended exercises\n\n\n\n\nTo-do:\n\nProgrammer’s groceries demo\n\nThe groceries.qmd notebook walks through examples of writing conditionals and defining functions based on a very old and cliche joke. The notebook includes both extensive markdown explanation and code in chunks you can run individually.\nStart by working through the notebook and executing the code, then experiment a little with the code to see if you can make things more efficient or introduce new scenarios.\n\nNext class on R Markdown & Quarto will be another dense lecture, so be sure to review the slides and read the required readings and preview the slides before class. Slides will be posted by Wednesday.\n\nRecommended exercises: View slides for additional details for each exercise.\n\nGitHub required files:\n\nRevisit the README.md and .gitignore files you created in the W1C2 exercises. With your new knowledge of the whats and whys of GitHub and these files, revise the README to make it more informative and revise the .gitignore to include any files or folders that fall into the categories we discussed in class.\n\nSimple .R script:\n\nWrite a simple .R script that (minimally) loads the tidyverse packages, requires a package, includes commented text, and assigns at least one numberic and one string variable. To go further, use vectors to create a data frame or tibble and/or source() your R script into a code chunk in an R Markdown document.\n\nhello_world() function:\n\nDefine a hello_world() function in an .R script that includes object assignment, conditional logic, and (ideally) a for or while loop. The function should take at least one argument and return at least two possible values.\nAssociated mini-project: 06_r-programming/01_hello-world\n\nSkeleton repo:\n\nCreate a GitHub repo connected to an R project for either a planned or fictional research project. In the R Project, create a “skeleton” that includes all the files and folders you anticipate needing for the project. Structure your repo to exclude all files and directories that should (for whatever reason) be excluded. As you work, use git best practices for version control, including frequent informative commit messages and functional, up-to-date README and .gitignore files.\nAssociated mini-project: 07_git-github/01_skeleton-repo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 2 | Class 2\n\n\n\n\nFriday, January 17, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore class: Markdown, quarto, and yaml readings\n\n\n\n\nReadings & Resources:\n\nIntro2R, Ch8 Reproducible Reports with R Markdown*\nR for Data Science, ch28: Quarto*\nQuarto Documentation:\n\nMarkdown basics\nOutput (YAML options): PDF & Word\n\nQuarto Getting Started tutorial\n\nNote: this tutorial uses the visual editor, which you should not use in this class!\n\nQuarto cheatsheet\nQuarto for R Markdown Users\nYAML:\nQuarto Authoring &gt; &gt; Front Matter\nYAML Tutorial (YAMLine)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClass meeting: Markdown & Quarto Fundamentals\n\n\n\n\nMaterials:\n\nSlides\n\nClass plans:\n\nLecture: Markdown & Quarto Fundamentals\nActivities\n\nProbably none, but if by some chance we get through the whole lecture with time to spare…\nReview the groceries notebook from last class\nWalk through creating the example hello_world() function\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfo: MLK day; mini-project submissions; timelines\n\n\n\n\nReminders:\n\nNo class on Monday, January 20th (MLK Day)\nWhen you submit mini-projects, make sure you read the assessment document instructions carefully. Specifically, know when to mark “objective attempt” and “unique objective attempt” in your submission. (You’ll never mark “objective met”, which is for graders.)\n\nAdditional information:\n\nThe no-deadlines-do-what-you-want assessment style of this class is supposed to make it easier, not harder, to learn. If you’re feeling overwhelmed, please let us know so we can help you get back on track! I suggest coming up with a loose timeline for when you’d like to submit mini-projects and research project drafts throughout the quarter, anticipating changes as we go.\nRecommendations to get you started:\n\nSubmit your first mini-project by the end of Week 3, and plan on 1 every 2 weeks after that\nSubmit a first (very incomplete!) draft of your research project by the end of Week 4, then additional drafts every 2-3 weeks as needed\n\nYour “draft” can be very, very simple. By the end of Week 4, you should be able to confidently demonstrate some skills across multiple categories – GitHub, R programming, markdown, and tidyverse, at least! You do not (and probably should not) wait to submit your first draft until it has all the components you want in the final project. Treat this as iterative and cumulative work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter class: Check on repo collaborator invites\n\n\n\n\nTo-do:\n\nDouble check that (1) you invited Dr. Dowling and your section’s TA to your repo(s) and (2) they accepted the invitation. If we didn’t accept, the invite link may have expired and you’ll need to re-invite us.\n\nRecommended exercises: View slides for additional details for each exercise.\n\nCreate apaquarto repos: Create directories for 3 (temporary) apaquarto projects using each of the 3 setup methods. Connect each to a (temporary) github repository. Play around to find where there is flexibility and where things can break.\nSimple .qmd notebook: Create a new quarto notebook (.qmd), and follow all best practices for notebooks and code chunks as you work. Add a YAML header, at least 1 setup code chunk, at least 1 non-setup code chunk, and narrative text formatted with markdown.\n\nAssociated mini-project: 05_data-communication/02_simple-qmd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnit 2: Managing data in the tidyverse\n\nWeek 3: Welcome to the Tidyverse\n\nTidy Data & Core Tidyverse Packages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 3 | Class 1\n\n\n\n\nMonday, January 20, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nNO CLASS | MLK DAY\n\n\n\n\nAll UChicago classes are cancelled for Martin Luther King Jr. Day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 3 | Class 2\n\n\n\n\nFriday, January 24, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore class: Tidyverse resources\n\n\n\n\nFeeling lost with the basics? The open-access book Introduction to R has a fantastic “getting started” overview. Review the Preface and Chapter 1 for the “how do I literally do anything?!” stuff and Chapter 2 for the “I’m doing things but I have no idea what the things I’m doing are” stuff.\nReadings & resources\n\nTidyverse guides & cheatsheets\n\nreadr* (direct pdf download)\ntibble\ndplyr* (direct pdf download)\nlook ahead to cheatsheets for more tv packages here (Wk4)\n\nr4ds intro chapters (recommend you read in this order - 7, 3, 5):\n\n7 - Data import*\n3 – Data transformation*\n5 - Data tidying : skim this for now, read it thoroughly before W4C1\n\nFor R converts coming from other data analyses:\n\nStata to R :: cheatsheet\nR for Stata Users (Muenchen & Hilbe)\nR for SAS & SPSS Users (Muenchen)\nFrom SPSS to R (Wolf)\nSwitching from Matlab to R (Richards)\nR for MATLAB users (cheatsheet-ish)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClass meeting: Tidy Data & Core Tidyverse Packages (Part 1)\n\n\n\n\nMaterials:\n\nSlides (v1 1/23/25 9:40am)\ndplyr pipeline demo: 00_in-class-materials/demo-snippets.R\n\nClass plans:\n\nLecture: Welcome to the Tidyverse Part 1: readr, tibble, dplyr\nIn-class exercise: reading and writing practice\nDemo (time permitting): dplyr pipelines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfo: Mini-project reminders/clarifications\n\n\n\n\nReminders:\n\nGet your forked d2mr-assessment repo set up and functional!! Top priority!! Attend TA office hours if you’re still having trouble.\n\nAdditional information:\n\nMini-projects should be fully distinct from your final project\n\nIf you want to use the same data in a very different way ask for an exception via the mini-project proposal process\nEven for exceptions, your MP should not be contained within your final project repo\n\nIn most cases, demonstrating the GitHub skills via a mini-project will require creating a new repo for the purposes of the project\nMPs should have a “home” in your assessment repo that contains (minimally) the assessment file\nExpect your MP grades to be lower earlier on, as the quarter goes on you’ll be able to show more and more skills within a single project\nFinal project repo names – make them informative!! This is part of git best practices.\n\n“early-childhood-shrugs” not “final-project-d2mr”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter class: Practice with readr and dplyr\n\n\n\n\nTo-do: Download and store the tidyverse cheatsheets\nRecommended exercises: View slides and mini-project repo files for additional details for each exercise.\n\nRead/write practice:\n\nIn a new notebook, use readr and related functions to read in a tabular dataset (.csv/.tsv), transform the data in some way, then write to a new .csv file. Replicate the process in an .R script, then source that script in the notebook.\nFind or create a variety of datasets to repeat the process, like different file types (e.g., .csv, google sheets, .xlsx, .sav), different “extras” (e.g, multiple tabs, rich formatting, non-data text, header rows), and different combinations of file locations (e.g., notebook and script in same folder folder, one in root folder and one in a subdirectory, writing/reading files in a lower- or higher-level subdirectory).\nPay attention to which packages are necessary to run which functions, which functions include which arguments (and the default argument values, and which differences in relative paths depending on function and file locations.\n\nData cleaning structured exercises:\n\nWalkthrough: Clean the iris Dataset\n\nDemo only! Walks you step by step through a cleaning process, setting you up to complete the Level 1 or 2 mini-projects.\nAssociated mini-project: 01_data-cleaning/00_cleaning-walkthrough\n\nLevel 1: Clean the mtcars Dataset\n\nWork with a simple dataset, focusing on basic data cleaning tasks. Most tasks are outlined in the assignment script.\nAssociated mini-project: 01_data-cleaning/01_cleaning-level-1\n\nLevel 2: Clean the midwest Dataset\n\nWork with a more complex dataset and perform more involved cleaning tasks. General guidance is given without much structured support.\nAssociated mini-project: 01_data-cleaning/02_cleaning-level-2\n\n\nGroup “uncleaning”:\n\nWork together with a classmate to each “unclean” a dataset for the other(s) to clean. Can be done in partners or small groups.\nAssociated mini-project: 01_data-cleaning/03_group-unclean\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 4: Manipulating Data\n\nTidying & Wrangling Data; Data Preparation Workshop\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 4 | Class 1\n\n\n\n\nMonday, January 27, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore class: tidyr, forcats, stringr, purrr\n\n\n\n\nReadings & Resources:\n\ndplyr joins\n\ndocumentation\nr4ds: 19 - joins\n\ntidyr\n\ndocumentation & cheatsheet\ntidyverse guide to tidy data\nr4ds: 5 – Data tidying\n\nforcats\n\ndocumentation & cheatsheet\nr4ds: 16 – Factors\n\nstringr\n\ndocumentation & cheatsheet\nr4ds: 14 – Strings\nr4ds: 15 – Regular expressions\n\npurrr (advanced, low priority for d2mr)\n\ndocumentation & cheatsheet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClass meeting: Tidying & Wrangling Data\n\n\n\n\nMaterials:\n\nSlides (updated 1/27/25 @12:15pm)\n\nClass plans:\n\nLecture: Tidying & wrangling data\n\nDemo code to be run along with the lecture (combining data, tidyr, stringr, and forcats) found in the demo-snippets.R script\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfo: Class time and Slack announcements\n\n\n\n\nReminders:\n\nBeginning this week, we will not spend class time addressing questions about class logistics, assignments, or other administrative topics. You will still have questions, and you will still get answers! But they will be asked and answered on Slack only.\nI will make announcements on Slack in the dedicated #announcements channel. You are responsible for all the information communicated this way, even if I never bring it up in class. Be sure you have notifications turned on for Slack. At a minimum, you should get a notification when someone tags you or @everyone, when someone directly replies to a thread you’re in, and when someone posts in the #announcements channel.\nThere is/was an out of date version of the assessment doc in the cleaning-level-1 mini-project. Please read the announcement in the Slack channel for more info and what to do if you have completed or intend to complete that project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter class: Prepare for workshop, (5!) wrangling exercises\n\n\n\n\nTo-do: Prepare for Friday’s workshop\nNote: The “conceptualize your dataset” exercise is designed to set you up for the workshop. I strongly recommend completing that exercise before Friday and spending your class time working on the to-do/to-learn list you generate, but you’re free to work on other projects if you prefer.\n\nSelect something to work on for the data preparation workshop on Friday. This can be a mini-project that involves cleaning and wrangling (not necessarily from the cleaning/wrangling categories) or part of the data prep needed for your final research project.\nCreate a to-do list for what you’d like to accomplish in the 80 minute workshop. Note which parts you can do on your own and which parts you’d like help with. You’ll have Dr. Dowling, your section TA, and your classmates to collaborate with; the more specific you can be identifying what you need help with ahead of time the more efficiently you’ll be able to get that help.\n\nRecommended exercises: View slides and mini-project repo files for additional details for each exercise.\n\nConceptualize your dataset:\n\nConceptualize the dataset you’ll need to create for your final research project. Imagine what kinds of figures you’d like to create or analyses you’d like to run. What variables and observations would you need for each? Articulate your research questions and hypotheses and see how they can map onto your dataset’s structure.\nCreate a tabular mockup of your goal dataset(s) using Excel, pencil and paper, or any non-programmy thing you like. Don’t worry about whether you know how to get there yet. Focus on structure, not code.\nIn your final research project repo, create an .R script called data-prep.R (or similar). Use comments to write out in plain English the steps you’ll need to take to turn your current dataset into your goal dataset.\nIdentify parts of the comments you can fill in now with R code you already know. Create a to-learn list for parts that you’ll need to learn new functions or techniques.\n\nData wrangling structured exercises:\n\nWalkthrough: Clean the iris Dataset\n\nWalkthrough doesn’t actually exist. At least not right now. Between the cleaning walkthrough, the cleaning projects, the in-class demos, and the highly structured format, you should be able to approach Level1 wrangling on your own. I may add one later if I see there is a need for it.\n\nLevel 1: Recreate a starwars Dataset\n\nWork with a medium-sized dataset (starwars) and transform to match a goal dataset. Most tasks are outlined in the assignment script.\nAssociated mini-project: 02_data-wrangling/01_recreate-level-1\n\nLevel 2: Recreate a gapminder Dataset\n\nWork with a more complex dataset and perform more involved wrangling and transformation tasks. General guidance is given without much structured support.\nAssociated mini-project: 02_data-wrangling/02_recreate-level-2\n\n\nWrangling group make-a-mess:\n\nWork together with a classmate to each dramatically transform/wrangle a dataset for the other(s) to recreate. Each partner will choose a publicly available dataset and transform it using tidyverse functions. You will then swap transformed datasets with your partner and attempt to recreate their work.\nAssociated mini-project: 02_data-wrangling/03_group-make-a-mess\n\nCreate a data wrangling function:\n\nDefine a function to execute procedural data wrangling tasks. Your final product should be an .R script that defines your function, then runs your function in a variety of test cases\n“Wrangling” is loosely defined here. It should be a function that serves a useful and plausible purpose for data preparation.\nNote: You may use your final research project data to guide the development of your function in this mini-project, but code you submit for this mini-project will not also count toward demonstrating objectives on your final project.\nAssociated mini-project: 06_r-programming/03_wrangling-function\n\nRecreate an existing function:\n\nRecreate one or more existing functions from base R or a package of your choice. Your final product should be an .R script that defines your function, then compares the output with that of the original function.\nThe goal is not to literally recreate the actual function, but to define a function that conceptually matches the function and achieves a similar result.\nNote: This may sound intimidating, but it really is an any-level project. You can work towards a fully equivalent function that does produces exactly the same outpu in all cases, or you can take a function and just break it down fully conceptually without writing any code at all. Or (I expect in most cases) anywhere in between.\nAssociated mini-project: 06_r-programming/04_recreate-function\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 4 | Class 2\n\n\n\n\nFriday, January 31, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore class: Make a plan!\n\n\n\n\n(same as “after class” above, just worth saying twice!)\n\nSelect something to work on in class. This can be a mini-project that involves cleaning and wrangling (not necessarily from the cleaning/wrangling categories) or part of the data prep needed for your final research project.\nCreate a to-do list for what you’d like to accomplish in the 80 minute workshop. Note which parts you can do on your own and which parts you’d like help with. You’ll have Dr. Dowling, your section TA, and your classmates to collaborate with; the more specific you can be identifying what you need help with ahead of time the more efficiently you’ll be able to get that help.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClass meeting: Data Preparation Workshop\n\n\n\n\nClass plans:\n\nCatch-up: If needed, we’ll catch up on any slides we didn’t get through on Monday.\nWorkshop: Data preparation - work solo, together with classmates, and with the support of Dr. Dowling & the TAs to make progress on either the data prep tasks necessary for your final project or a mini-project relating to (at least in part) data cleaning and wrangling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfo:\n\n\n\n\nReminders:\nAdditional information:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter class:\n\n\n\n\nTo-do:\nRecommended exercises:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnit 3: Analyzing and visualizing data\n\nWeek 5: Data Visualization with ggplot2\n\nA Grammar of Graphics; Visualization Workshop\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 5 | Class 1\n\n\n\n\nMonday, February 3, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore class: ggplot2 resources\n\n\n\n\nReadings & Resources:\n\nChapters on data visualization and ggplot in r4ds: 1 and 9, 10, 11\nggplot2 cheatsheet\nggplot2-Book (note: 3e is currently “under construction” but it’s still a great resource!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClass meeting: A Grammar of Graphics\n\n\n\n\nMaterials:\n\nSlides (v1 2/3/25 12:30pm)\nCloning the assessment repo\nggplot2 walkthrough part 1\n\nYou can access this and run it as a stand-alone document without the rest of the repo\n\n\nClass plans:\n\nLecture: Introduction to Data Visualization with ggplot2 (A grammar of graphics)\nActivities:\n\nFix the fork problem\nggplot2 walkthrough part 1 (together with slides)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfo: Fork/clone situation; Friday’s workshop\n\n\n\n\nReminders:\n\nAssessment repo changes: We are moving to a new system where you will clone the assessment repo and then set the upstream repo to the main class repo. This is an alternative to forking that gives us (instructors) more control over the upstream repo and you more control over your own repo. See the guide here.\n\nThis change is mandatory. I know this is coming at a bad time and will be very frustrating for some people. I’m here to help! Please post issues in the Slack so we can resolve things quickly.\nWhat do I do with my fork? No matter what, create a local backup first. I suggest deleting your fork when you are confident the new clone system is set up and working correctly. That will help avoid confusion (on your end and mine) about which repo is the “real” one, it will prevent accidental pull requests to the main repo, and it will ensure you’re the only one with full control over your work.\nI’m working on a mini-project now in my fork, what do I do? If you clone your forked repo, all your ongoing work will be in the new repo. Double check that the cloned files are up to date, then continue working in the clone and abandon the work in your fork.\nWhat if I already submitted mini-projects with my fork? Not a problem. You have two options: 1) Leave your fork up for now until your projects have been graded (and finalized by Dr. Dowling). When your grade is finalized, copy the graded assessment.md file into your new clone so that you have a record of your progress in your in-use repo. 2) Resubmit your mini-project to Canvas with a link to the directory in your new clone repo. In either case, once there are no outstanding submitted Canvas assignments with links to your fork, I recommend deleting your fork.\n\nFriday’s workshop: Friday’s class will be a data visualization workshop. Unlike the Week 4 workshop, this won’t be a “free work” period. You should come prepared to discuss your needs and goals for visualizing data for your final research project. We’ll work as a class to concetpualize what your plots should look like and prepare to make them in ggplot.\n\nIf needed, we will devote about 15 minutes to resolving issues with the GitHub change, but we have to limit that time. Please use Slack and your troubleshooting resources to resolve as many issues as possible before Friday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter class: Fix your repo, start data viz projects\n\n\n\n\nTo-do:\n\nDownload the ggplot2 cheatsheet\nMigrate from the github forked assessment repo to a new cloned repo, following the directions in this guide and getting support on Slack if needed\nPrepare for Friday’s workshop by picking 2 tentative plans to visualize data for your final research project. Be ready to share in small groups and as a whole class!\n\nRecommended exercises:\n\nData visualization structured exercises:\n\nWalkthrough: Introduction to data visualizaton with ggplot2 (pt1)\n\nDemo only! This is the demo the lectures follow along with. Part 2 will be added next week.\nAssociated mini-project: 03_data-viz/00_viz-walkthrough\n\nLevel 1: Visualize the mtcars Dataset\n\nWork with a simple dataset to recreate 3 basic plots (using only data, aes, and geoms) and 3 intermediate plots that add other commonly used elements.\nAssociated mini-project: 03_data-viz/01_viz-level-1\n\nLevel 2: Visualize the starwars Dataset\n\nWork with a more complex dataset to recreate 1 advanced (and hideous) plot using many layers and theme elements.\nAssociated mini-project: 03_data-viz/02_viz-level-2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 5 | Class 2\n\n\n\n\nFriday, February 7, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore class: Data viz theory to application\n\n\n\n\nReadings & resources:\n\nfrom Data to Viz (interactive guide for selecting appropriate visualization)\nBe Awesome in ggplot2: A Practical Guide to be Highly Effective\nDesigning effective data visualization (Johns Hopkins Libraries)\nTen Simple Rules for Better Figures\n\nTasks:\n\nPlan to workshop 1 or 2 plots from your final research project data in class, in both large group and small group settings. The “from Data to Viz” link above can be a good starting point.\nTake a look at the new mini-projects that have been posted this week (there are a lot!). In addition to projects about data visualization, there are instructions for most MPs in the “miscellaneous” category and a handful of others in other categories. If you see a project that is interesting to you but see that you don’t know everything you would need to complete 100% of the project, remember it’s totally ok to simplify the projects or focus just on the skills do you know instead of waiting until you’ve got everything mastered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClass meeting: Data visualization Workshop\n\n\n\n\nClass plans:\n\nActivities: (no lecture)\n\n(if needed) 15 minutes support for github clone setup\nLarge group visualization workshop\nSmall group visualization collaboration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfo: Engagement grades\n\n\n\n\nReminders:\n\nMid-quarter engagement grades: Provisional community engagement grades are posted Friday Week 5. This is to give you a sense of what you can expect your final engagement grade to be if you continue participating in class at the same level you have been so far. Remember:\n\nGrades are assigned by Dr. Dowling, with input from TAs about how they have seen students engage that Dr. Dowling may not see\nThese grades will be fully replaced at the end of the quarter, and no matter what your grade is now there is the potential to gain all 10 points by the end of the quarter.\nThe easiest way to bump up your grade is by participating more on Slack. You can see more suggestions for how to raise this component of your grade here.\nFeel like your grade doesn’t accurately reflect your engagement thus far? Two possibilities:\n\nYou could be wrong. Not that you’re not trying, but that you may be overestimating your engagement relative to the course expectations. Take a minute to reflect a bit on your participation thus far, read over the suggestions for ways to engage, and consider that this grade starts at 0, not 10 (you earn points; you don’t lose them).\nYou could be right! If you think you’re engaging in ways that Dr. Dowling and the TAs haven’t noticed, you can let us know! The “Community Engagement” assignment on Canvas (where you see the provisional grade) has an optional submission component. You can use this submission as a way to show/tell us how you’ve been an active part of the class community in ways we aren’t aware of. You can submit and resubmit to this assignment as many times as you like over the rest of the quarter, but you won’t receive a re-evaluated numeric grade until the end of the quarter.\n\nAside from giving us more information about your own engagement, please use the assignment submission to let us know how you have seen your classmates positively engage with the community! Someone start a study group? Help you debug your code for 2 hours on a Sunday night out of the goodness of their heart? Give you particularly useful insight during a class workshop? Use this as a place to give them a shout out so they can get the points they deserve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter class: More ggplot; make a timeline; additional MPs\n\n\n\n\nTo-do: Make a submission plan & timeline\nYou’re (more than) half way through the quarter — how far along are you toward earning the 50 mini-project points and 40 research project points? Given that projects allow you to show cumulatively built skills, it’s reasonable to expect that it will be easier to earn more points in the second half of the quarter once you’ve got a lot of the basics under your belt.\nTake a few minutes to make plan for how you’re going to earn the points you need for the grade you want. Are the mini-projects overwhelming? Maybe you want to turn in a lot of small projects instead of a couple big ones. Are they boring? Design your own! Confused by the grading? The sooner you turn in projects, the sooner you get a sense of how grading works, and the more time you leave yourself to earn all the points you want.\nSame goes for the final research project. You’ve got 4 tries to earn the full 40 points, and you do not have to aim to meet all 40 at once. In fact, I strongly suggest you do not wait until you’re at a point where you can reasonably get everything at once. By that point we’ll be very late in the quarter, and you probably won’t have time to submit more than one try.\nRecommended exercises:\n\nData visualization exercises:\n\nData visualization Level 1 and Level 2 mini-projects (posted after last class)\n\nAssociated mini-project: 03_data-viz/01_viz-level-1\nAssociated mini-project: 03_data-viz/02_viz-level-2\n\nGroup/pairs swap plots\n\nWork with a partner to create and recreate data visualizations using ggplot2. Each partner will create a complex visualization from a dataset, then challenge their partner to recreate it using only the dataset and a static image of the final plot.\nAssociated mini-project: 03_data-viz/04_group-swap-plots\n\nCreate a plotting function\n\nDefine a function that creates customized plots using ggplot2. Your final product should be an .R script that defines your function, then demonstrates its use with various datasets and argument combinations.

Optionally, clone the repo to play around with the files. You can set up a relationship to the upstream repo to pull in changes if you want, but it’s not necessary if you don’t want the git headache.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClass meeting: “Pretty” plots\n\n\n\n\nMaterials:\n\nSlides (v1 2/20/25 @11am)\nData viz walkthrough part 2 (03_data-viz/00_viz-walkthrough-2)\nExample apaquarto manuscript (d2mr-apaquarto repo)\n\nClass plans:\n\nLecture: Pretty plots\nSmall groups: .qmd figures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfo: Notes on grading\n\n\n\n\nGrading notes\n\nMeeting objectives: To make sure you get credit for the objectives you attempt to demonstrate, read through the assessment doc before submission to see if you’ve done the suggested tasks for each. For example:\n\n(5) Find, install, require, and load R packages: Did you use more than one function?\n(6) Use arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators: Did you use all 3 types?\n(8) Parse and write conditional statements and/or loops: Do your conditionals use more than one function in more than one context?\n(9) Use readr functions to read in and write out data: Will your script read in data for your grader (use relative paths!)?\n(22) Create and effectively use code chunks following best practices: Do all your chunks have unique and informative labels?\n(26) Create and maintain a quarto document YAML header: Does your header include options for an APA styled document?\nYou can still get credit for an objective without exactly matching the recommended tasks, but you’ll need to show effort and capability that is essentially the equivalent. If you believe you’ve done so, make a note of how you’ve shown comparable skills in your assessment document.\n\nObjective categories: When you’re attempting objectives, be conscious of the category each is under. Keep the broader context in mind. For example:\n\nGit and GitHub: These objectives should show your abilities to create and maintain projects using git. Working in a git repository that you didn’t make or editing a readme file that you didn’t create doesn’t showcase your skills (it showcases mine). Effectively using version control doesn’t just mean you pushed to github, it means you’re using the git and github systems as an effective replacement for not using the git systems.\nNotebooks and code chunks: These objectives should demonstrate your ability to effectively use markdown notebooks to execute skills demonstrated elsewhere. Maybe you made beautiful ggplots that met all plotting objectives, but to get (24) you need to integrate those figures into a notebook, including referencing it in the text. It’s not about the plotting skills; it’s about the markdown and notebook skills.\nR Markdown and Quarto: These objectives should show your ability to create and maintain publication quality documents — the manuscript part of “Data to Manuscript.” Like with Git/GitHub, you’ll need to show your abilities to create and maintain (not mine), and you’ll need to show how the skills work in a publication-styled document. For example, to show “(27) Use quarto R Markdown to compose an academic manuscript,” it’s not enough to just use bold formatting and create lists; you need to show the markdown formatting in an academic manuscript.\n\nAsk us! If you’re feeling uncertain about what “counts” or you don’t understand your grades, ask Dr. Dowling and your TA for help understanding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter class: Secure data; level 2 data viz exercises\n\n\n\n\nTasks:\n\nUsing public data? Download everything you need locally. The politics of research right now is unpredictable and horrifying. Control what little you can by creating a local version of data or any other materials needed for your work.\n\nRecommended exercises:\n\nData visualization walkthrough (part 2)\n\nContinuation of the ggplot demo. Part 2 covers more advanced skills, including the scales, facets, and theme layers.\nAssociated files: 03_data-viz/00_data-viz-walkthrough-2\n\nCreate a ggplot2 theme\n\nCreate a custom ggplot2 theme that reflects your personal visualization style while maintaining clarity and professionalism (or not). Your theme should be reusable across different types of plots and demonstrate understanding of ggplot2’s theming system, including effective uses of the theme() layer and (optionally) non-data-dependent visual elements created as arguments of non-theme layers.\nAssociated mini-project: 03_data-viz/03_ggplot-theme\n\n(OTS) Non-ggplot figures\n\nCreate a data visualization project that demonstrates your ability to create publication-quality plots using R packages other than ggplot2. You may use alternatives to ggplot2 or extensions.\nAssociated mini-project: 03_data-viz/06_ots-non-ggplot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 6 | Class 2\n\n\n\n\nFriday, February 14, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore class: Table resources & packages\n\n\n\n\nReadings & documentation:\n\nR Graph Gallery’s guide to table packages\nPandoc tables\nr4ds: 28.8 Tables\napaquarto: Tables\nQuarto: Tables\nRMarkdown Cookbook: Ch10 Tables\n\nPackages for table-making:\n\nknitr (kables) and kableExtra (better kables)\nstargazer package for statistical reporting & tutorial\nflextable package and extensive guide\ngt (Grammar of Tables), gtsummary, & gtextras\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClass meeting: Tables\n\n\n\n\nMaterials:\n\nSlides\n\nClass plans:\n\nLecture & demo: Making tables in Quarto\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfo: Research project progress\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in: How’s your final research project going?

How confident are you that you know what you need to get the grade you want? If you’re feeling at all unsure about your final project, turn something in now. If it’s a mess and you would get a bad grade, wouldn’t you rather find that out now while you have several weeks to turn that bad grade into a perfect score?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter class: Start thinking stats\n\n\n\n\nTasks:\n\nBefore Monday, decide on at least 1 descriptive analysis you would like to conduct with your data. It’s time to make a preliminary analysis plan for your research project data. On Monday we’ll talk about executing simple descriptive statistics in R, and on Friday we’ll cover simple hypothesis testing. Neither of these sessions is intended to be a stats class. We’ll learn how to execute analyses in R and we’ll go over the absolute basics of what different kinds of tests are used for, but it is up to you to know what you need to do in the best interests of your project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 7: Basics of data analysis (for psychologists+)\n\nDescriptive Statistics; Hypothesis Testing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 7 | Class 1\n\n\n\n\nMonday, February 17, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore class: Descriptive Statistics Resources\n\n\n\n\nReadings & resources:\n\nStats and R\n\nCorrelogram in R: how to highlight the most correlated variables in a dataset\nCorrelation coefficient and correlation test in R\nWhat statistical test should I do?\n\nWith a much bigger and better flowchart than mine!!\n\nDescriptive statistics in R\n\nA Practical Extension of Introductory Statistics in Psychology using R\n\nCh 6 Correlation\nCh 7 One-sample t-test\nCh 8 Dependent samples t-test\nCh 9 Independent samples t-test\n\nLearning Statistics with R\n\nCh 5 Descriptive Statistics\nCh 13 Comparing two means\n\nDesc.

Remember that you’ll need to include both for full points. We’ll cover how to implement common hypothesis testing/inferential statistics on Friday (e.g., ANOVA, chi2, linear regression, glm), and you’ll want to be ready to try them out with your data during class. If you know you’ll need to include a specific kind of analysis that’s not one of the “basics,” drop a message in the #help-stats-and-analysis channel with info about what you’ll be using and I may add it to the materials for Friday if it’s something I think others would benefit from covering too.\nRecommended exercise:\n\nDescriptive statistics structured exercise:\n\nPractice using R to calculate and interpret descriptive statistics. Unlike in previous assignments, you will not use a built-in dataset. Instead, you will use data from a published, open-access dataset capturing relationships between math anxiety and self-perception. The exercise includes simple tasks with tables and ggplot.\nAssociated files: 04_data-analysis/01_descriptive\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 7 | Class 2\n\n\n\n\nFriday, February 21, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore class: Inferential Statistics Resources\n\n\n\n\nReadings & Resources:\n\nStats and R\n\nANOVA in R\nMultiple linear regression made simple\nBinary logistic regression in R\nChi-square test of independence in R\n\nA Practical Extension of Introductory Statistics in Psychology using R\n\nCh 5 Simple Linear Regression\nCh 10 One-way ANOVA\nCh 12 GLM Approach Summary\n\nLearning Statistics with R\n\nCh 12 Categorical data analysis\nCh 14 Comparing several means (1-way ANOVA)\nCh 15 Linear regression\n\nBrown VA.

If I’m right, I want to fix this as soon as possible since we’re nearing the end of the quarter. The 2 biggest things I want to communicate in this long message are:\n\nTalk to me if you need help.\nDon’t let flexibility be a distraction.\n\nNot sure how many projects to do? Which projects to do? What counts as assessed and unassessed and off the menu and off the syllabus or any of the other terms I’m throwing around? Please ask me.This is the first time using an alternative grading system in this class, and it’s important to me that it is a better experience for you than the old system. Clearly not everything is going 100% smoothly, and I’m learning as we go what parts of the course design need fixing. That’s all well and good for future students who will benefit from changes made going forward, but I have a responsibility to make sure the less-than-helpful parts of the system aren’t holding you back right now.If you are feeling unsure about how to get the grade you want, please email me. We can work out a plan to give you more structure and guidance to get you where you want to go. You don’t have to just flail and guess and hope for the best.In addition to encouraging you to ask for help with your specific circumstances, here are some general bits of advice:\n\nAgain, don’t let flexibility be a distraction. If you’re looking at this vast “menu” and all the many times I say “do whatever!” on the website and it’s making you feel like you don’t know where to start, tune it out. Pick the mini-projects you’re going to do now from the ones already published, ignore the optional/challenge parts, and set yourself deadlines for submission (you can ask me or the TAs to help you set goals).\nYou only have to meet 20 unique objectives across all mini-projects. Pick which 20 you want those to be and work toward them. Frustrated by git and/or apaquarto and dreading the idea of making a new repo for those purposes? Don’t include those objectives in your 20.\n\nI expect most students will need to complete 3-5 mini-projects to earn 50 points. If you’re not sure how many you should try, budget time for 6-7.\nTo help you plan, I’ve put together a list of all published mini-projects along with the essential info about each. View that list here.\nIf you’re unsure how to earn a point for some particular objective, look at the recommendations in the assessment file and follow them to the letter. In some cases that will mean forcing in some arbitrary elements just to prove you can.\n\nFor the other 20 points, there’s a good chance that in the work you’re already doing you are checking off some of the “unassessed” objectives. Adding lots of comments? Using internally consistent style? Planning out your plots with the grammar of graphics? Transforming your data into a tidy format because you can identify that it needs to be tidy for plotting? These are all points. When you complete the assessment for a project, look at that list carefully and see if there are any points you already did without even thinking about it and/or if there are some you could hit with minimal additional effort.\nYou do not need to push yourself to complete projects to exceptional standards. Remember: Done is better than good. If you have to choose between getting something done and making something “good,” choose done. In this system you are cumulatively earning points, not losing points for imperfections. There’s no reason not to turn in “bad” work if it’s going to get you to your ultimate goal.\nIf the “off-the-menu” and “off-the-syllabus” project ideas are confusing, just ignore them. You don’t need either. These are there for people who are already motivated to pursue them for their own interests, not to distract anyone from focusing on the basics.\n\nI genuinely want every person in this class to earn an A, and from what I’ve seen so far I think you all can. Again, it’s my responsibility to make sure this new class structure is not so chaotic that it harms your learning or your grades, but I can’t help you if you don’t let me know there’s a problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter class: Get organized! And test hypotheses\n\n\n\n\nTo-do: Make/review you plan\n\nIt’s the end of 7th week — how close are you to the 50 mini-project points? The 40 research project points? What do you need to do to get the grade you want by the end of the quarter?\nDeadlines:\n\nMini-projects due March 5th (Wed Week 9)\nFinal research projects due March 12th (Wed Finals Week)\n\n\nRecommended exercise:\n\nInferential statistics structured exercise:\n\nPractice using R to analyze data with common inferential statistics techniques. The exercise includes some work with ggplot2 and opportunities to use inline R code in narrative statistical interpretation.\nAssociated files: 04_data-analysis/02_hypothesis-testing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnit 4: Disseminating research dynamically\n\nWeek 8: Creating your manuscript\n\nDynamic text; BibTeX & citr\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 8 | Class 1\n\n\n\n\nMonday, February 24, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore class: Cross-references and inline code\n\n\n\n\nReadings & Resources:\n\nQuarto Documentation\n\nInline code\nCross-references\n\nQuarto for Scientists (Tierney, 2024)\n\nCiting figures, tables, and sections\nInline code\n\nDatanovia\n\nQuarto Cross References\nQuarto Computations (code blocks and inline code)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClass meeting: Dynamic text, part 1\n\n\n\n\nMaterials:\n\nSlides (v2 2/24/25 @1:00pm)\n\nNote: These slides will be used for both Monday and Friday of Week 8\n\nd2mr-apaquarto repo\n\nClass plans:\n\nLecture: Dynamic text, part 1 (cross-references, inline R code)\nReferencing and code demo with the d2mr-apaquarto repo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfo: End of quarter deadlines; grading\n\n\n\n\nDeadlines:\n\nWednesday, February 26th (this week!!!): Last day to submit and receive feedback on a research project draft\nWednesday, March 5th: Last day to submit mini-projects\nWednesday, March 12th: Last day to submit final research projects\n\nGrading:\n\nTimelines: Grading can take a lot of time. Yuchen, Mian, and I are all grading as quickly as we can, and our goal is to get you feedback as soon as possible so you know what you need to do for the remainder of the quarter. For the most part, the TAs are handling mini-projects, and I am handling the research projects. We grade in the order that we receive submissions, so the earlier you submit, the earlier you’ll get a grade. At this point in the quarter, everyone is submitting many projects and drafts at once, so you should expect a longer turnaround than submissions earlier in the quarter.\nFeedback: On your assessment form, there should be a commented explanation any time you do not receive credit for an attempted objective. In some cases you will get general comments on the submission as a whole, but in the interests of time, we are focusing on the objectives. If you don’t see general feedback at the end of the assessment document, it’s not because we didn’t grade your work holistically and thoroughly. It’s simply that we must be pragmatic with our time to get everyone feedback quickly.\nResearch project assessment document: The final research project has its own assessment document: research-assessment.md. You can find this file in the top level of your assessment repository. Copy and paste the document into your project’s repo and complete in full. Please use the most up-to-date version of this document.\n\nChanges to this document from the version posted at the beginning of the quarter:\n\nMore detailed overall expectations for the project (structure, content, etc.)\nAI statement & optional AI use reflection\nClarifications of expectations for some objectives\nRelaxed (easier to meet) expectations for some objectives\nOptional project reflection section\nGrading summary section\n\nIf you submitted a draft on or before Sunday, February 23rd using an older version of the assessment, I have updated it for you.\nIf you submit a draft on or after Monday, February 24th, you must use the most up-to-date version of the assessment document. Submissions using the older version will be asked to resubmit with the correct document. Since I won’t notice the older assessment until I get to your draft in my grading queue, this may delay returning your graded work to you.\nWhen you submit a second (or later) draft of your research project, you should simply update the document that already has your previous feedback. Do not create a new assessment document and do not remove grader comments from the previous draft.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter class: Preview and set up bibtex\n\n\n\n\nTo-do:\n\nPreview the remainder of the slides for dynamic text (bibtex citations)\nFollow the guide to setup a Zotero-citr workflow\n\nTime-permitting, we’ll do this together in class on Friday.

If you are considering this option, reach out to Dr. Dowling as soon as possible.\n\nGrades:\n\nEmail me this week (ASAP!) to negotiate a pass/fail option\nGrading scale (point to letter grade conversion)\n\nCommunity engagement:\n\nFinal engagement grades will replace the mid-quarter grades\nThe Canvas assignment where you see the mid-quarter grade is actually a real assignment\n\nYou may (optionally) submit something to that assignment describing how you’ve been engaged in the class in ways I may not have seen\nYou may also use this to give credit to classmates who have been supportive\n\nReminder: Engagement grades are not attendance grades or easy points. You earn up to 10 by doing more than the minimum.\n\nOffice hours:\n\nDr. Dowling will hold extra office hours over Zoom during Week 9 and finals week. Sign up here.\n\nPlease do not sign up for more than 1 appointment!\n\nIf you would like to attend multiple, you can attend in pairs or groups (ie each individual student signs up for 1 appointment but everyone attends all of them together).\n\nMeetings on Wednesday March 5th and Friday March 7th may take place either over Zoom or in person in my office. We’ll assume Zoom by default, but send me an email if you book one of those times and prefer to meet in person.\nUnfortunately I do not have availability outside these extra time slots, but you are free to reach out to me or the TAs over email. And as always, post to Slack!\n\nMian and Yuchen may hold additional office hours. We will keep you updated with Slack announcements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter class: Keep working on your projects!\n\n\n\n\nMini-project tips:\n\nPanicking? There’s a good chance you’re overthinking things.\n\nFigure out what the bare minimum is that you would need to do to get the points you need for a project, and just do that.\nStill have time for a little more? Great, put in a little more to count toward you engagement score.\nDidn’t get everything done? Kind of a bummer, but whatever. Turn in what you have!\n\nRealizing you were overambitious?\n\nCut your losses and swap to an easier and/or more structured project. No judgment.\n\nActually some judgment, but in a good way. I will judge you positively for making a reasoned decision about priorities and organization.\n\n\nReview the graded assessment files for past MPs.\n\nIn some cases the TAs may have indicated you can revise and resubmit, in which case you should do that!\n\nIf they didn’t note it on your assessment, you can ask your TA if they will accept a resubmission, but it is entirely at their discretion. Remember the general policy is no MP resubmissions allowed — this is a kindness from the TAs!\n\nNote where and why you missed attempted objectives. In many cases it is for very tiny things that are very easily fixable in the next project you complete.\n\n\nFinal project tips:\n\nRead the research-assessment.md document closely before you go to complete it for submission!!\n\nIncludes a thorough description of the overall expectations. Failing to meeting these will be reflected in your engagement score.\nIncludes detailed explanations for meeting each objective. Read these closely! There are many that are very easy to meet and very easy to miss\n\nI may give credit for work that does not meet all the outlined expectations for an objective if I believe it has demonstrated mastery of the objective in another way\nYou are required to complete the AI statement. Failure to do so will result in a 5 point penalty.\nUse the most recent version of the assessment document! If you don’t see a detailed list of overall expectations, a section for your AI statement, a reflection section, or a grading section, you’ve got the wrong version!\n\nAside from just missing these sections, you’re missing important clarifications and simplifications for objective expectations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 9 | Class 2\n\n\n\n\nFriday, March 7, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore class: Submit mini-projects, work on final projects\n\n\n\n\nMini-projects are (were) due Wednesday March 5th. Reading this before then? Great! Don’t forget to turn them in!\nWork on making progress on your final research project. We’ll be workshopping for all of class on Friday, so plan ahead for what you want to focus on while you’ve got people around to help.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClass meeting: Final project workshop\n\n\n\n\nNo lecture, no activities, just 80 minutes of time to work on your final research projects together with the professor, TA, and your classmates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfo: Deadlines & office hours\n\n\n\n\nDeadlines:\n\nMini-projects are due this Wednesday, March 5th at 11:59pm\nFinal drafts of research projects are due next Wednesday, March 12th at 11:59pm\n\nNo extensions\nSyllabus is designed to allow students who need extended deadlines to pace their work throughout the quarter without having to make special requests\n\nToday (Friday Week 9) is the latest day to negotiate a pass/fail plan. If you are considering this option, reach out to Dr. Dowling as soon as possible.\n\nOffice hours:\n\nDr. Dowling will hold extra office hours over Zoom during Week 9 and finals week. Sign up here.\n\nPlease do not sign up for more than 1 appointment!\n\nIf you would like to attend multiple, you can attend in pairs or groups (ie each individual student signs up for 1 appointment but everyone attends all of them together).\n\nMeetings on Wednesday March 5th and Friday March 7th may take place either over Zoom or in person in my office.

We will keep you updated with Slack announcements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter class: Live your best life with data and manuscripts\n\n\n\n\nWe’re done!\n\nSubmit your final draft by next Wednesday. Whatever you’ve submitted by 11:59pm on Wednesday will become your final grade for the project.\nBe on the lookout for a survey from me about the class and improvements for future quarters.\nSubmit a community engagement reflection if you like.\nPlease keep in touch with me and with each other! The Slack will stay open at least through Spring quarter.\nGoing to be around next year? Let me know if you’re interested in TAing for D2MR!"
